\newglossaryentry{frustum}{
    name={frustum},
    plural={frusta},
    description={In geometry: defined as the portion of a solid, normally a cone or pyramid, that lies between two parallel planes.
    In computer graphics: the viewing frustum is the three-dimensional region which is visible on screen.}

\newglossaryentry{point_cloud}{
    name={point cloud},
    plural={point clouds},
    description={A set of points in some reference system.
        In a three dimension corrdination system, the points typical represent the cartesian position of the external surface of an object.
    Frequently generated from a 3D scanning process, these points are rarely used directly but rather converted into a surface representation, such as a polygonal mesh.}

\newglossaryentry{implicit_shape}{
    name={implicit shape},
    plural={implicit shapes},
    description={In mathematics: an implicit shape or surface is the surface in Euclidean space defined by an equation \( F(x, y, z) = 0\).
    The implicit surface is the zero set of the function \( F \), and is termed \textit{implicit} as the function is not solved for \( x, y, \text{ or } z \).}

    Each vertex belongs to exactly two edges and similarly each edge has exactly two vertices.}

{%
    A rendering technique which determines the object in a three-dimensional scene that is visible for each pixel of an image.

    Suppose that we are given a three dimensional scene consisting of several objects, a light source, and a view point.
    In order to generate an image of the scene, we must determine for each pixel of the image, for example \( 1280 \times 1024\) pixels, which object is visible at that pixel, and second the intensity of the light that is reflected from the object to particular view point.
    Raycasting is concerned with determining the intersection of a ray from the view point towards the objects of the scene.
    The first object that this ray intersects is the visible object.
    Raytracing is a complementary procedure concerned with determining the intensity and properties of the reflected light from the object.
}

\newglossaryentry{raytracing}{
    name={raytracing},
    see={raycasting},
    description={A rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light from a source and it's interaction with virtual objects of a scene.
    Sometimes used interchangeably with raycasting.}
