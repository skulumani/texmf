	Abstract = {The mass extinction at the K/P (Cretaceous--Paleogene) boundary was caused by an extraterrestrial impact and the following abrupt climate/environment change. In this study, numerical simulations of asteroid/comet impact on the oceanic crust of the earth are carried out by using the hydrocode AUTODYN-2D (ANSYS, Inc.). The objective of this work is to estimate how much impact debris is ejected into the atmosphere. Therefore the accumulations of ejected mass originating from different sources were calculated as functions of time at different altitudes. It is found that about 50 tera-tons of seawater and 35 tera-tons of crust are ejected when a 10 km diameter asteroid collides on the Earth with the speed of 20 km/s. The values increase to 240 and 175 tera-tons when the asteroid diameter is increased to 20 km. It is also demonstrated that a typical comet disintegrates and bounces back into the atmosphere due to small density, while much heavier asteroids do not recoil much. },

	Abstract = {The chances that Earth will collide with a significant near earth object (NEO) within the next century are very small, but such a collision is possible, would be catastrophic, and could happen at any time. Much discussion has been devoted to methods of diverting these objects away from Earth through the use of space technology. However, if these efforts are unsuccessful, we would need to implement effective strategies to survive the event, no matter how cataclysmic. To date, disaster management for various impact scenarios has not been addressed (except in novels and Hollywood films). An impact disaster may be many orders of magnitude greater than any disaster the human species has ever experienced. Initially, technology and experience gained in other large-scale disasters will most likely form the foundation of how these impact events will be managed and classified. Given the size and energy of the projectile, the estimated area of damage, and whether impact effects might be localized or global in nature, we can begin to build basic disaster response scenarios, anticipate public health concerns, and formulate questions in need of answers. Questions we must deal with include: what will be required technologically, sociologically, and medically to survive? What types of evacuation plans and warning systems might be required? Capabilities in need of further investigation include: technological protection strategies related to `impact winter', expanded chemical hazard control methodologies, food storage and production, roles of national governments, and international cooperation. Whatever the magnitude and severity of the event, we must reflect on what we know, what capabilities we can apply, develop or adapt, and seriously investigate what might be done to manage it and survive. },

@article{chapman2004,
	Abstract = {Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) have struck the Earth throughout its existence. During epochs when life was gaining a foothold ∼4 Ga, the impact rate was thousands of times what it is today. Even during the Phanerozoic, the numbers of \{NEAs\} guarantee that there were other impacts, possibly larger than the Chicxulub event, which was responsible for the Cretaceous--Tertiary extinctions. Astronomers have found over 2500 \{NEAs\} of all sizes, including well over half of the estimated 1100 \{NEAs\} &gt;1 km diameter. \{NEAs\} are mostly collisional fragments from the inner half of the asteroid belt and range in composition from porous, carbonaceous-chondrite-like to metallic. Nearly one-fifth of them have satellites or are double bodies. When the international telescopic Spaceguard Survey, which has a goal of discovering 90% of \{NEAs\} &gt;1 km diameter, is completed, perhaps as early as 2008, nearly half of the remaining impact hazard will be from land or ocean impacts by bodies 70--600 m diameter. (Comets are expected to contribute only about 1% of the total risk.) The consequences of impacts for civilization are potentially enormous, but impacts are so rare that worldwide mortality from impacts will have dropped to only about 150 per year (averaged over very long durations) after the Spaceguard goal has, presumably, ruled out near-term impacts by 90% of the most dangerous ones; that is, in the mid-range between very serious causes of death (disease, auto accidents) and minor but frightening ones (like shark attacks). Differences in perception concerning this rather newly recognized hazard dominate evaluation of its significance. The most likely type of impact events we face are hyped or misinterpreted predicted impacts or near-misses involving small NEAs. },

	Abstract = {On 15 February 2013, the Russian district of Chelyabinsk, with a population of more than 1 million, suffered the impact and atmospheric explosion of a 20-meter-wide asteroid{\textemdash}the largest impact on Earth by an asteroid since 1908. Popova et al. (p. 1069, published online 7 November; see the Perspective by Chapman) provide a comprehensive description of this event and of the body that caused it, including detailed information on the asteroid orbit and atmospheric trajectory, damage assessment, and meteorite recovery and characterization. The asteroid impact near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on 15 February 2013 was the largest airburst on Earth since the 1908 Tunguska event, causing a natural disaster in an area with a population exceeding one million. Because it occurred in an era with modern consumer electronics, field sensors, and laboratory techniques, unprecedented measurements were made of the impact event and the meteoroid that caused it. Here, we document the account of what happened, as understood now, using comprehensive data obtained from astronomy, planetary science, geophysics, meteorology, meteoritics, and cosmochemistry and from social science surveys. A good understanding of the Chelyabinsk incident provides an opportunity to calibrate the event, with implications for the study of near-Earth objects and developing hazard mitigation strategies for planetary protection.},

	Abstract = {Several questions in the statistical mechanics of non-Hamiltonian systems are discussed. The theory of differential forms on the phase space manifold is applied to provide a fully covariant formulation of the generalized Liouville equation. The properties of invariant volume elements are considered, and the nonexistence in general of smooth invariant measures noted. The time evolution of the generalized Gibbs entropy associated with a given choice of volume form is studied, and conditions under which the entropy is constant are discussed. For non-Hamiltonian systems on manifolds with a metric tensor compatible with the flow, it is shown that the associated metric factor is in general a time-dependent solution of the generalized Liouville equation.},

	Abstract = {Relative equilibria of a dumbbell-type spacecraft consisting of two bodies separated by an elastic link is studied in a central gravitational field. The only other forces present in the system are two internal forces acting on the spacecraft to control its attitude and its shape. Linearized equations from the Routh reduction technique are derived. These are used to demonstrate the local controllability properties for the attitude, shape, and orbital equations of the dumbbell spacecraft. Stability conditions of the relative equilibria are determined and then analyzed through examples. The effects of the gravity gradient, and the coupling between attitude, shape, and orbital dynamics, can be used to change the energy of the spacecraft. Thus, through control of the attitude and/or shape, the orbit of the spacecraft can be modified with minimal fuel expenditure},

	Abstract = {An elastic dumbbell spacecraft is assumed to consist of two identical mass particles that are connected by a long elastic link. The motion of the dumbbell spacecraft can be described by orbit, attitude and shape dynamics that arise due to gravitational forces, an elastic restoring force along the longitudinal axis of the spacecraft, and control forces that act to change the attitude and shape of the spacecraft. These control forces have the property that there is no net external force on the dumbbell spacecraft. Since the angular momentum of the spacecraft is necessarily conserved, Routh reduced equations of motion are developed that describe the reduced dynamics of the controlled spacecraft. The reduced equations of motion are developed; relative equilibria are determined, and simplified reduced equations, in a linear form, are obtained. These linear reduced equations demonstrate spacecraft controllability properties. It is shown that certain maneuvers, involving a change in orbit, can be accomplished using only attitude and shape control inputs. The proposed framework can be used to study this propulsion force approach to orbital maneuvers.},

	Abstract = {In this paper the problem of two, and thus, after a generalization, of an arbitrary finite number, of rigid bodies is considered. We show that the Newton-Euler equations of motion are Hamiltonian with respect to a certain non-canonical structure. The system possesses natural symmetries. Using them we shown how to perform reduction of the number of degrees of freedom. We prove that on every stage of this process equations of motion are Hamiltonian and we give explicite form corresponding of non-canonical Poisson bracket. We also discuss practical consequences of the reduction. We prove the existence of 36 non-Lagrangean relative equilibria for two generic rigid bodies. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach allows to simplify the general form of the mutual potential of two rigid bodies.},

	Abstract = {Interaction between orbital motion and attitude libration dynamics of an arbitrary rigid body moving in a central Newtonian field is considered to second order. Advantage is taken of the decoupling between inplane-pitch and roll-yaw out-of-plane motion to restrict the motion to the orbital plane by an appropriate choice ofinitial conditions. An averaged solution to the nonlinear inplane-pitch equations whose accuracy is determined by ignoring terms of order {\{}$\epsilon${\textperiodcentered}G32/a2, $\epsilon$2,$\alpha$$\epsilon$2,G32/a2{\}} and higher is presented. The results show that the near-resonant motion is characterized by a periodic interchange of energy between the attitude and orbital motion.},

@article{koon2004,
	Abstract = {Abstract:  The purpose of this paper is to describe the general setting for the application of techniques from geometric mechanics and dynamical systems to the problem of asteroid pairs. The paper also gives some preliminary results on transport calculations and the associated problem of calculating binary asteroid escape rates. The dynamics of an asteroid pair, consisting of two irregularly shaped asteroids interacting through their gravitational potential is an example of a full-body problem or FBP in which two or more extended bodies interact. One of the interesting features of the binary asteroid problem is that there is coupling between their translational and rotational degrees of freedom. General FBPs have a wide range of other interesting aspects as well, including the 6-DOF guidance, control, and dynamics of vehicles, the dynamics of interacting or ionizing molecules, the evolution of small body, planetary, or stellar systems, and almost any other problem in which distributed bodies interact with each other or with an external field. This paper focuses on the specific case of asteroid pairs using techniques that are generally applicable to many other FBPs. This particular full two-body problem (F2BP) concerns the dynamical evolution of two rigid bodies mutually interacting via a gravitational field. Motivation comes from planetary science, where these interactions play a key role in the evolution of asteroid rotation states and binary asteroid systems. The techniques that are applied to this problem fall into two main categories. The first is the use of geometric mechanics to obtain a description of the reduced phase space, which opens the door to a number of powerful techniques, such as the energy-momentum method for determining the stability of equilibria and the use of variational integrators for greater accuracy in simulation. Second, techniques from computational dynamic systems are used to determine phase space structures that are important for transport phenomena and dynamic evolution.},

@article{demars2012,
	Abstract = {The population of space objects (SOs) is tracked with sparse resources and thus tracking data are only collected on these objects for a relatively small fraction of their orbit revolution (i.e., a short arc). This contributes to commonly mistagged or uncorrelated SOs and their associated trajectory uncertainties (covariances) to be less physically meaningful. The case of simply updating a catalogued SO is not treated here, but rather, the problem of reducing a set of collected short-arc data on an arbitrary deep space object without a priori information, and from the observations alone, determining its orbit to an acceptable level of accuracy. Fundamentally, this is a problem of data association and track correlation. The work presented here takes the concept of admissible regions and attributable vectors along with a multiple hypothesis filtering approach to determine how well these SO orbits can be recovered for short-arc data in near realtime and autonomously. While the methods presented here are explored with synthetic data, the basis for the simulations resides in actual data that has yet to be reduced, but whose characteristics are replicated as well as possible to yield results that can be expected using actual data.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of the probability density function of the state conditioned on all available measurement data provides the most complete possible description of the state, and from this density any of the common types of estimates (e.g., minimum variance or maximum a posteriori) can be determined. Except in the linear Gaussian case, it is extremely difficult to determine this density function. In this paper an approximation that permits the explicit calculation of the a posteriori density from the Bayesian recursion relations is discussed and applied to the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem. In particular, it is noted that a weighted sum of Gaussian probability density functions can be used to approximate arbitrarily closely another density function. This representation provides the basis for procedure that is developed and discussed.},

	Abstract = {The educational, occupational, and creative accomplishments of the profoundly gifted participants (IQs ⩾ 160) in the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) are astounding, but are they representative of equally able 12-year-olds? Duke University's Talent Identification Program (TIP) identified 259 young adolescents who were equally gifted. By age 40, their life accomplishments also were extraordinary: Thirty-seven percent had earned doctorates, 7.5% had achieved academic tenure (4.3% at research-intensive universities), and 9% held patents; many were high-level leaders in major organizations. As was the case for the SMPY sample before them, differential ability strengths predicted their contrasting and eventual developmental trajectories---even though essentially all participants possessed both mathematical and verbal reasoning abilities far superior to those of typical Ph.D. recipients. Individuals, even profoundly gifted ones, primarily do what they are best at. Differences in ability patterns, like differences in interests, guide development along different paths, but ability level, coupled with commitment, determines whether and the extent to which noteworthy accomplishments are reached if opportunity presents itself.},

	Abstract = {The variable structure control (VSC) with sliding mode is presented to design a tracking control law to ensure the fast and accurate response and robustness of guidance law in this paper. First, the small body dynamic equation is deduced in the landing site coordinate system. Second, the desired trajectory is planned in the condition of safe soft landing constraints. Third, the guidance law based on \{VSC\} is designed to track the desired trajectory and succeed in landing on the surface of small body. Finally, the guidance and control algorithm is formed and the effectiveness of algorithm is verified by numerical Monte Carlo simulations. },

	Abstract = {In this paper, we review the recent results on stability and control for time-varying sets of nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and utilize them for the problem of multi-vehicle coordinated motion in the context of obstacle avoidance where obstacles are approximated and enclosed by elliptic shapes. Specifically, we design distributed controllers for individual vehicles moving in a specified formation in the presence of such obstacles. The obstacle avoidance algorithm that we propose is based on transitional trajectories which are denned by a set of ordinary differential equations that exhibit a stable elliptical limit cycle. The control framework is implemented on the system of double integrators and is shown to globally exponentially stabilize moving formation of the agents in pursuit of a leader while ensuring obstacle avoidance.},

	Abstract = {Using Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptive backstepping controller is presented in this paper for optimal descent tracking. Unlike the traditional approach, the proposed control law can cope with input saturation and failure which enables the embedded autonomy of lander system. In addition, this control law can also restrain the unknown bounded terms (i.e., disturbance). To show the controllerʼs performance in the presence of input saturation, input failure and bounded external disturbance, simulation was carried out under a lunar landing scenario. },

@article{condurache2008,
	Abstract = {The paper offers a comprehensive study of the motion in a central force field with respect to a rotating non-inertial reference frame. It is called Foucault Pendulum-like motion and it is a generalization of a classic Theoretical Mechanics problem. A closed form vectorial solution to this famous problem is presented. The vectorial time-explicit solution for the classic Foucault Pendulum problem is obtained as a particular case of the considerations made in the present approach. New interesting conservation laws for the Foucault Pendulum-like motion are deduced by using simple differential and vectorial computations. They help to visualize the shape of the trajectories. Exact vectorial expressions for the law of motion and the velocity are also offered. The case of the driven Foucault Pendulum is also analyzed, and a closed form solution is deduced based on the general considerations. In the end, an new tensorial prime integral for the Foucault Pendulum problem is offered. It helps to reveal in a concise form, within a single entity, all the scalar and vectorial conservation laws for the Foucault Pendulum motion. Two important engineering applications to this approach are presented: the motion of a satellite with respect to a rotating reference frame and the Keplerian relative orbital motion. The latter has a great importance in modeling the problems concerning satellite formation flying, satellite constellations and space terminal rendezvous. The classic problem of the harmonic oscillator in an electromagnetic field is also solved by using the instruments presented in this paper. },

	Abstract = {Introduction.  The duration of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) may give rise to subjective complaints of premature ejaculation (PE) and is usually determined by self-assessment or by stopwatch.Aim.  The aim of this study was to investigate the IELT distribution in the general male population and the accuracy of IELT assessment by using a blinded timer device instead of a stopwatch, thereby minimizing possible interference with the spontaneous and natural way of having intercourse.Methods.  The IELT was measured with a timer device during 4 weeks in a nonselected sample of 474 men from The Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, Turkey, and the United States. Questionnaires were administered before and after the 4-week IELT assessments.Main Outcome Measures.  IELT; erectile function dysfunction score of International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF).Results.  The IELT had a positively skewed distribution, with a geometric mean of 5.7 minutes and a median of 6.0 minutes (range: 0.1--52.1 minutes). Men from Turkey had the shortest median IELT (4.4 minutes). Men from the United Kingdom had the longest IELT (10.0 minutes). Circumcision and condom use had no significant impact on the median IELT. Subjects who were discontent with their latency time had slightly lower median IELT values of 5.2 minutes than the median of the population.Conclusion.  The IELT distribution, measured with a blinded timer device, is very similar to the IELT distribution of our previous population survey which utilized a stopwatch. In the general male population, complaints of discontent with self-perceived latency had a slightly lower median IELT value than the median of the overall population.

	Abstract = {Some ants have an extraordinary social organization, called unicoloniality, whereby individuals mix freely among physically separated nests. This type of social organization is not only a key attribute responsible for the ecological domination of these ants, but also an evolutionary paradox and a potential problem for kin selection theory because relatedness between nest mates is effectively zero. The introduction of the Argentine ant in Europe was apparently accompanied by a dramatic loss of inter-nest aggression and the formation of two immense supercolonies (which effectively are two unicolonial populations). Introduced populations experienced only limited loss of genetic diversity at neutral markers, indicating that the breakdown of recognition ability is unlikely to be merely due to a genetic bottleneck. Rather, we suggest that a ``genetic cleansing'' of recognition cues occurred after introduction. Indeed workers of the same supercolony are never aggressive to each other despite the large geographical distance and considerable genetic differentiation between sampling sites. By contrast, aggression is invariably extremely high between the two supercolonies, indicating that they have become fixed for different recognition alleles. The main supercolony, which ranges over 6,000 km from Italy to the Spanish Atlantic coast, effectively forms the largest cooperative unit ever recorded.},

	Abstract = {Abstract An intercept mission with nuclear explosives is the most effective of the practical mitigation options against the impact threat of near-Earth objects (NEOs) with a short warning time (e.g., much less than 10 years). The existing penetrated subsurface nuclear explosion technology limits the intercept velocity to less than approximately 300 m/s. Consequently, an innovative concept of blending a hypervelocity kinetic impactor with a subsurface nuclear explosion has been developed for optimal penetration, fragmentation, and dispersion of the target NEO. A proposed hypervelocity asteroid intercept vehicle (HAIV) consists of a kinetic-impact leader spacecraft and a follower spacecraft carrying nuclear explosives. This paper describes the conceptual development and design of a baseline \{HAIV\} system and its flight validation mission architecture for three mission cost classifications (e.g., $500 M, $1 B, and $1.5 B). },

	Abstract = {This paper describes a method of recovering linear controllability of an underactuated spacecraft by accounting for the effects of solar radiation pressure (SRP) in the spacecraft attitude dynamics model. The developments are based on a spacecraft model with a four wheel reaction wheel array of which two wheels have failed and two wheels are functioning. The model for SRP torque as a function of spacecraft attitude is incorporated into the state-space description of the system. Under suitable assumptions, the linearization of the underacted spacecraft model (with SRP effects included) is shown to be linearly controllable. This conclusion is exploited to define a novel approach for handling reaction wheel failures based on conventional Linear Quadratic (LQ) controllers. The results of the linear and non-linear simulations illustrate the ability to recover pointing by controlling two functioning reaction wheels while two other wheels undergo subsequent failures.},

@article{van-wilgenburg2010,
	Abstract = {Ants are among the most damaging invasive species, and their success frequently arises from the widespread cooperation displayed by introduced populations, often across hundreds of kilometers. Previous studies of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) have shown that introduced populations on different continents each contain a single, vast supercolony and, occasionally, smaller secondary colonies. Here, we perform inter-continental behavioral analyses among supercolonies in North America, Europe, Asia, Hawaii, New Zealand and Australia and show that these far-flung supercolonies also recognize and accept each other as if members of a single, globally distributed supercolony. Furthermore, populations also possess similar genetic and chemical profiles. However, these ants do show aggression toward ants from South Africa and the smaller secondary colonies that occur in Hawaii and California. Thus, the largest and most dominant introduced populations are likely descended from the same ancestral colony and, despite having been established more than 100 years ago, have diverged very little. This apparent evolutionary stasis is surprising because, in other species, some of the most rapid rates of evolutionary change have occurred in introduced populations. Given the spatial extent of the Argentine ant society we report here, there can be little doubt that this intercontinental supercolony represents the most populous known animal society.},

	Abstract = {One of the techniques used in the past decade to determine the shape with a good accuracy and estimate certain physical features (volume, mass, moments of inertia) of asteroids is the polyhedral model method. We rebuild the shape of the asteroid 433 Eros using data from 1998 December observations of the probe Near-Earth-Asteroid-Rendezvous-Shoemaker. In our computations, we use a code that avoids singularities from the line integrals of a homogeneous arbitrary shaped polyhedral source. This code evaluates the gravitational potential function and its first- and second-order derivatives. Taking the rotation of asteroid 433 Eros into consideration, the aim of this work is to analyse the dynamics of numerical simulations of 3D initially equatorial orbits near the body. We find that the minimum radius for direct, equatorial circular orbits that cannot impact with the Eros surface is 36 km and the minimum radius for stable orbits is 31 km despite significant perturbations of its orbit. Moreover, as the orbits suffer less perturbations due to the irregular gravitational potential of Eros in the elliptic case, the most significant result of the analysis is that stable orbits exist at a periapsis radius of 29 km for initial eccentricities ei ≤ 0.2.},

	Abstract = {This article considers the two-dimensional elliptic restricted three-body problem, and in particular some of its aspects related to regularization and periodic collision orbits. The mechanism of regularization with Birkhoff coordinates and with theenergy differential equation is described. Then the initial conditions for collision orbits are established. The theory is illustrated with the description of a new family of symmetric periodic collision orbits. It is shown how this family is related to the work of Moulton, Darwin and Stromgren in the circular restricted problem, and also to the Earth-Moon mass ratio. In the high eccentricity ranges, some relations with the triple collision problem are pointed out. The differential corrections have been made with an automatic search technique which is described in the appendix.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a method to construct optimal transfers between unstable periodic orbits of differing energies using invariant manifolds. The transfers constructed in this method asymptotically depart the initial orbit on a trajectory contained within the unstable manifold of the initial orbit and later, asymptotically arrive at the final orbit on a trajectory contained within the stable manifold of the final orbit. Primer vector theory is applied to a transfer to determine the optimal maneuvers required to create the bridging trajectory that connects the unstable and stable manifold trajectories. Transfers are constructed between unstable periodic orbits in the Sun--Earth, Earth--Moon, and Jupiter-Europa three-body systems. Multiple solutions are found between the same initial and final orbits, where certain solutions retrace interior portions of the trajectory. All transfers created satisfy the conditions for optimality. The costs of transfers constructed using manifolds are compared to the costs of transfers constructed without the use of manifolds. In all cases, the total cost of the transfer is significantly lower when invariant manifolds are used in the transfer construction. In many cases, the transfers that employ invariant manifolds are three times more efficient, in terms of fuel expenditure, than the transfer that do not. The decrease in transfer cost is accompanied by an increase in transfer time of flight.},

	Abstract = {Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) is an excellent method to stabilize mechanical systems in the Hamiltonian formalism. In this paper, several improvements are made on the IDA-PBC method. The skew-symmetric interconnection submatrix in the conventional form of IDA-PBC is shown to have some redundancy for systems with the number of degrees of freedom greater than two, containing unnecessary components that do not contribute to the dynamics. To completely remove this redundancy, the use of quadratic gyroscopic forces is proposed in place of the skew-symmetric interconnection submatrix. Reduction of the number of matching partial differential equations in IDA-PBC and simplification of the structure of the matching partial differential equations are achieved by eliminating the gyroscopic force from the matching partial differential equations. In addition, easily verifiable criteria are provided for Lyapunov/exponential stabilizability by IDA-PBC for all linear controlled Hamiltonian systems with arbitrary degrees of underactuation and for all nonlinear controlled Hamiltonian systems with one degree of underactuation. A general design procedure for IDA-PBC is given and illustrated with examples. The duality of the new IDA-PBC method to the method of controlled Lagrangians is discussed. This paper renders the IDA-PBC method as powerful as the controlled Lagrangian method.},

@article{belczynski2010,
	Abstract = {Data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (~300,000 galaxies) indicate that recent star formation (within the last 1 billion years) is bimodal: half of the stars form from gas with high amounts of metals (solar metallicity) and the other half form with small contribution of elements heavier than helium (~10%-30% solar). Theoretical studies of mass loss from the brightest stars derive significantly higher stellar-origin black hole (BH) masses (~30-80 M ☉ ) than previously estimated for sub-solar compositions. We combine these findings to estimate the probability of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) arising from the inspiral of double compact objects. Our results show that a low-metallicity environment significantly boosts the formation of double compact object binaries with at least one BH. In particular, we find the GW detection rate is increased by a factor of 20 if the metallicity is decreased from solar (as in all previous estimates) to a 50-50 mixture of solar and 10% solar metallicity. The current sensitivity of the two largest instruments to neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) binary inspirals (VIRGO: ~9 Mpc; LIGO: ~18) is not high enough to ensure a first detection. However, our results indicate that if a future instrument increased the sensitivity to ~50-100 Mpc, a detection of GWs would be expected within the first year of observation. It was previously thought that NS-NS inspirals were the most likely source for GW detection. Our results indicate that BH-BH binaries are ~25 times more likely sources than NS-NS systems and that we are on the cusp of GW detection.},

	Abstract = {To study forms in plants and other living organisms, several mathematical tools are available, most of which are general tools that do not take into account valuable biological information. In this report I present a new geometrical approach for modeling and understanding various abstract, natural, and man-made shapes. Starting from the concept of the circle, I show that a large variety of shapes can be described by a single and simple geometrical equation, the Superformula. Modification of the parameters permits the generation of various natural polygons. For example, applying the equation to logarithmic or trigonometric functions modifies the metrics of these functions and all associated graphs. As a unifying framework, all these shapes are proven to be circles in their internal metrics, and the Superformula provides the precise mathematical relation between Euclidean measurements and the internal non-Euclidean metrics of shapes. Looking beyond Euclidean circles and Pythagorean measures reveals a novel and powerful way to study natural forms and phenomena.},

	Abstract = {This dissertation studies the orbital motion of a spacecraft about a rotating second degree and order gravity field, with its main application to orbital motion about uniformly rotating, irregular-shape asteroids. Such dynamical systems are non-integrable in general. Our goal is to understand how the orbital dynamics change as a function of the central body's rotation rate and mass distribution. To carry out this analysis we use three different approaches: averaging, resonance analysis, and periodic orbit computation. By using these analyses, we can better understand the character of a spacecraft's motion around an asteroid, which is much different from spacecraft motion around the Earth or other planets in the Solar system. Specifically, the main contributions of this dissertation are as follows. First a definition for size-shape stability of orbital motion is proposed and two facts are presented, which are related to the orbital stability of spacecraft motion in the rotating second degree and order gravity field. Second, the secular motions of a spacecraft are studied for three cases: when the central body does not rotate, rotates slowly, and rotates rapidly. The averaged Lagrange equations are derived and analyzed for these cases. Third, the short-period motions related to resonance are analyzed using the elliptic expansions of semi-major axis and eccentricity, and averaging near a resonance between the asteroid rotational and orbital motion. Fourth, periodic orbits are studied, including search methods, existence and stability analyses; five basic families of periodic orbits are found. Finally, a summary of the results in this dissertation is given, and their relations to our size-shape stability definition are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The stability of orbital motion about a uniformly rotating arbitrary second degree and order gravity field is investigated. A normalized form of the equations of motion are derived and analyzed. A numerical stability criteria is proposed and used to evaluate the stability of initially near-circular orbits in the equatorial plane of the body. Regions of stable and unstable motion are clearly delineated, and are seen to be strongly related to resonances between the mean motion and the body rotation rate. },

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a computational method to solve constrained cooperative motion planning problems for multiple vehicles undergoing translational and rotational motions. The problem is solved by means of the Lie group projection operator approach, a recently developed optimization strategy for solving continuous-time optimal control problems on Lie groups. State constraints (for collision avoidance) are handled by means of a set of barrier functions, turning the optimization approach into an interior point method. A sample computation is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

	Abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses `value networks'to evaluate board positions and `policy networks'to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a fast solver for the optimization problem arising in the nonlinear model predictive control of spacecraft attitude is developed and simulation results of its application to constrained spacecraft attitude control are presented. The solver exploits the numerical solution of the necessary conditions for optimality in a discrete-time optimal control problem defined over a prediction horizon, where the discrete-time dynamics are based on the Lie group variational integrator model. The inequality constraints (thrust constraint, inclusion/exclusion zone constraints, etc.) are handled using a penalty function approach. Our developments exploit the geometric mechanics and control formalism.},

	Abstract = {Recent analyses have shown that distant orbits within the scattered disk population of the Kuiper Belt exhibit an unexpected clustering in their respective arguments of perihelion. While several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can successfully account for the observations remains elusive. In this work we show that the orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) cluster not only in argument of perihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such a clustering has only a probability of 0.007% to be due to chance, thus requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass ≳10 m ⊕ whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the distant KBOs, but whose perihelion is 180$\,^{\circ}$ away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed orbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the presence of high-perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60$\,^{\circ}$ and 150$\,^{\circ}$ whose origin was previously unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and highly inclined outer solar system objects provides the opportunity for testing our hypothesis as well as further constraining the orbital elements and mass of the distant planet.},

	Abstract = {The restricted three-body problem is considered for values of the Jacobi constant C near the value \{C2\} associated to the Euler critical point L2. A Lyapunov family of periodic orbits near L2, the so-called family (c), is born for C = \{C2\} and exists for values of C less than C2. These periodic orbits are hyperbolic. The corresponding invariant manifolds meet transversally along homoclinic orbits. In this paper the variation of the transversality is analyzed as a function of the Jacobi constant C and of the mass parameter μ. Asymptotical expressions of the invariant manifolds for C ≲ \{C2\} and μ ≳ 0 are found. Several numerical experiments provide accurate information for the manifolds and a good agreement is found with the asymptotical expressions. Symbolic dynamic techniques are used to show the existence of a large class of motions. In particular the existence of orbits passing in a random way (in a given sense) from the region near one primary to the region near the other is proved. },

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new geometric adaptive control system with state inequality constraints for the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. The control system is designed such that the desired attitude is asymptotically stabilized, while the controlled attitude trajectory avoids undesired regions defined by an inequality constraint. In addition, we develop an adaptive update law that enables attitude stabilization in the presence of unknown disturbances. The attitude dynamics and the proposed control systems are developed on the special orthogonal group such that singularities and ambiguities of other attitude parameterizations, such as Euler angles and quaternions are completely avoided. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental results.},

	Abstract = {Space trajectory design is often achieved through a combination of dynamical systems theory and optimal control. The union of trajectory design techniques utilizing invariant manifolds of the planar circular restricted three-body problem and the optimal control scheme Discrete Mechanics and Optimal Control (DMOC) facilitates the design of low-energy trajectories in the N-body problem. In particular, DMOC is used to optimize a trajectory from the Earth to the Moon in the 4-body problem, removing the mid-course change in velocity usually necessary for such a trajectory while still exploiting the structure from the invariant manifolds. This thesis also focuses on how to adapt DMOC, a method devised with a constant step size, for the highly nonlinear dynamics involved in trajectory design. Mesh refinement techniques that aim to reduce discretization errors in the solution and energy evolution and their effect on DMOC optimization are explored and compared with trajectories created using time adaptive variational integrators. Furthermore, a time adaptive form of DMOC is developed that allows for a variable step size that is updated throughout the optimization process. Time adapted DMOC is based on a discretization of Hamilton's principle applied to the time adapted Lagrangian of the optimal control problem. Variations of the discrete action of the optimal control Lagrangian lead to discrete Euler-Lagrange equations that can be enforced as constraints for a boundary value problem. This new form of DMOC leads to the accurate and efficient solution of optimal control problems with highly nonlinear dynamics. Time adapted DMOC is tested on several space trajectory problems including the elliptical orbit transfer in the 2-body problem and the reconfiguration of a cubesat.},

	Abstract = {We develop nonlinear reference governor and nonlinear model predictive control schemes for constrained spacecraft attitude control. The schemes use the nonlinear discrete-time model of spacecraft dynamics based on the Lie group variational integrator evolving on SO(3) × SO(3). The reference governor is a computationally simpler add-on to the nominal controller, while the model predictive controller provides faster response and better performance. The stability properties and constrained domains of attraction of these schemes are analyzed and their capability to perform global rest-to-rest reorientation maneuvers is established. Simulation results are reported where controllers perform specified reorientation maneuvers while adhering to torque and inclusion zone constraints.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops a control methodology that unifies control barrier functions and control Lyapunov functions through quadratic programs. The result is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control, which presents both safety and performance considerations, as well as actuator bounds. We begin by presenting a novel notion of a barrier function associated with a set, formulated in the context of Lyapunov-like conditions; the existence of a barrier function satisfying these conditions implies forward invariance of the set. This formulation naturally yields a notion of control barrier function (CBF), yielding inequality constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the simultaneous achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). These formulations are illustrated in the context of adaptive cruise control, where the control objective of achieving a desired speed is balanced by the minimum following conditions on a lead car and force-based constraints on acceleration and braking.},

	Abstract = {{This paper proposes a methodology-based on convex navigation
   functions-for three-axis attitude reorientation for a rigid body
   spacecraft in presence of multiple constraints. In this direction, two
   types of attitude constrained zones are first defined, namely, the
   attitude forbidden and mandatory zones. The paper then utilizes a convex
   parameterization of forbidden and mandatory zones for constructing a
   logarithmic barrier potential function that is subsequently used for the
   synthesis of the attitude control laws. The feasible controller-which
   uses the feedback of the unit quaternions in the context of the proposed
   methodology- is then implemented using a modified integrator
   backstepping method in order to compromise the actuator saturations. The
   paper concludes with a set of simulation results in order to evaluate
   the effectiveness, and demonstrate the viability, of the proposed
   methodology.}},

@article{murray1994,
	Abstract = {Barrier methods for constrained optimization, widely applied in the 1960s and 1970s, have recently enjoyed a revival of popularity. A line search with respect to a logarithmic barrier function or related potential function is often part of modern interior methods. Standard line search procedures tend to be inefficient in this context for two reasons; an inappropriate choice of initial trial step if any constraints are nonlinear, and poor approximation of the barrier function by loworder polynomial interpolants. This paper discusses line search strategies specifically designed for the logarithmic barrier function.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents four types of tracking control systems for the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. First, a smooth control system is constructed to follow a given desired attitude trajectory, while guaranteeing almost semi-global exponential stability. It is generalized to achieve global exponential stability by using a hybrid control scheme based on multiple configuration error functions. They are further extended to obtain robustness with respect to a fixed disturbance using an integral term. The resulting robust, global exponential stability for attitude tracking is the unique contribution of this paper.},

	Abstract = {The formation relative motion control by using one body fixed thruster and reaction wheels is a challenging problem due to the coupled translational and rotational dynamics. As the thruster vector depends on the current attitude and its angular velocity, and some of the attitude constraints also couple the position and attitude of the spacecraft, it makes the formation control problem high dimensional. This paper develops two decoupling conditions, including thrust vector maneuverability condition and included angle condition between the thruster and the star camera boresight, and then presents two methods to calculate the target attitude quaternion. Both of the two methods need first design the optimal trajectory of the thrust vector, and then use geometric and nonlinear programming methods to calculate the attitude trajectory. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a typical application of a dual-spacecraft formation initialization.},

	Abstract = {Coordinated control problem of translation and rotation between two spacecraft is investigated in this paper. Using dual quaternion, we establish the relative coupled dynamic model in which the coupling effect between translational and rotational motion is indicated. Based on the logarithm of dual quaternion, a model-independent PD-like controller is proposed for spacecraft tracking control problem. The convergence of the closed loop system in the presence of external disturbances is proven theoretically. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated by numerical simulations. The advantages of the proposed controller are displayed by comparing with others. },

@article{finocchietti2014,
	Abstract = {Abstract The design of interplanetary trajectories based on patched circular restricted three body models is gradually becoming a valuable alternative to the classical patched conic approach. The main advantage offered by such a model is the possibility to exploit the manifold dynamics to move naturally far from or toward a body. Generally, propulsive maneuvers are required to match these structures. Low-thrust arcs offer the possibility to have a significant propellant mass reduction when moving from manifold to manifold. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology to design low-thrust trajectories between two planetary orbits connecting the manifolds of two circular three body systems. The approach is based on a grid search on the main parameters governing the solution to identify those trajectories moving within the manifold images on given Poincar{\`e} sections. The value of the Jacoby constant of the target libration point periodic orbit is chosen as stop condition for the thrusting phases. Ballistic arcs follow up to the proper Poincar{\`e} section intersection. A grid search for an Earth to Venus transfer is presented as test case. },

	Abstract = {There are currently more than 19,000 trackable objects in Earth orbit, 1,300 of which are active. With so many objects populating the space object catalog and new objects being added at an ever increasing rate, ensuring continued access to space is quickly becoming a cornerstone of national security policies. Space Situational Awareness (SSA) supports space operations, space flight safety, implementing international treaties and agreements, protecting of space capabilities, and protecting of national interests. With respect to objects in orbit, this entails determining their location, orientation, size, shape, status, purpose, current tasking, and future tasking. For active spacecraft capable of propulsion, the problem of determining these characteristics becomes significantly more difficult. Optimal control techniques can be applied to object correlation, maneuver detection, maneuver/spacecraft characterization, fuel usage estimation, operator priority inference, intercept capability characterization, and fuel-constrained range set determination. A detailed mapping between optimal control applications and SSA object characterization support is reviewed and related literature visited. Each SSA application will be addressed starting from first-principles using optimal control techniques. For each application, several examples of potential utility are given and discussed.},

	Abstract = {Computational savings in reachability set subspace computation are realized by carefully applying transversality conditions to trajectory samplings of the full reachability set. Differential constraints on the initial state and initial constraint Lagrange multiplier are developed that enforce the necessary conditions of optimality as total trajectory duration increases. Results are validated against known linear analytical results and an example is given where a 1-dimensional subspace of a 6-dimensional nonlinear problem is computed.},

	Abstract = {The problem of free-time optimal reachability set computation with alternate integral constraints is motivated and examined. Specific examples of such systems are optimal spacecraft, aircraft and automobile free-time, fuel-limited range computation. An alternate Hamilton Jacobi Bellman PDE formulation is derived using a Generalized Independent Parameter (GIP) associated with the integration constraint and GIP mapping function with respect to time is defined. Necessary conditions on the GIP mapping function are identified and discussed. Singular independent parameter mapping functions, often found in astrodynamics optimal control problems, are shown to be challenging to solve using a simple change of integration variable, motivating an approach to transform such problems before solving. Several short illustrations are used to emphasize theoretical cases of interest, and two simple fully-worked examples are given to demonstrate the potential utility of this approach.},

	Abstract = {Questions of reachability for continuous and hybrid systems can be formulated as optimal control or game theory problems, whose solution can be characterized using variants of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman or Isaacs partial differential equations. The formal link between the solution to the partial differential equation and the reachability problem is usually established in the framework of viscosity solutions. This paper establishes such a link between reachability, viability and invariance problems and viscosity solutions of a special form of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. This equation is developed to address optimal control problems where the cost function is the minimum of a function of the state over a specified horizon. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that the properties of the value function (uniform continuity) and the form of the partial differential equation (standard Hamilton--Jacobi form, continuity of the Hamiltonian and simple boundary conditions) make the numerical solution of the problem much simpler than other approaches proposed in the literature. This fact is demonstrated by applying our approach to a reachability problem that arises in flight control and using numerical tools to compute the solution.},

	Abstract = {Existing reachability and optimal control theory are applied to a class of nonlinear systems with ellipsoidal initial reachability sets. Analytical expressions for general state partition extrema are developed, yielding necessary conditions for reachability as well as tools for significant reduction in reachability computation. Similar relations for position and velocity reachability set surface computation are also developed and the computation implications discussed. Several examples are worked to illustrate results, and finally directions for future work are discussed.},

	Abstract = {This work deals with the design of transfers connecting LEOs with halo orbits around libration points of the Earth--Moon CRTBP using impulsive maneuvers. Exploiting the coupled circular restricted three-body problem approximation, suitable first guess trajectories are derived detecting intersections between stable manifolds related to halo orbits of EM spatial CRTBP and Earth-escaping trajectories integrated in planar Sun--Earth CRTBP. The accuracy of the intersections in configuration space and the discontinuities in terms of Δv are controlled through the box covering structure implemented in the software GAIO. Finally first guess solutions are optimized in the bicircular four-body problem and single-impulse and two-impulse transfers are presented.},

	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with some reformulations of the classical computational scheme for solving optimal control problems via Pontryagin's maximum principle. The purpose is to alleviate some well known difficulties involved in solving a two-point boundary value problem in terms of adjoint variables. To this end there is discussion of the avoidance of explicit use of transversality conditions and the use of initial control rather than adjoint variables as the basis of the iterative procedure. The application of these ideas to some practical problems of spacecraft trajectory optimization is considered.},

	Abstract = {The development of electric propulsion systems such as ion engines has brought low-thrust control into practical use. This has made the design of spacecraft trajectories with low continuous thrust more and more demanding. This work concerns low-energy transfer trajectories between the Jupiter satellites using effectively the n-body dynamics in the Jupiter system and low-thrust controls. To analyze the dynamics of n-body models, we use the three-body problem as a model and apply the patched three-body approximation. We also use invariant manifold tubes and the result provides how to connect two different manifolds with low-thrust, low-energy trajectories.},

	Abstract = {Traditional method is Hohmonn transfer following the two-body model, but the Japanese Hiten mission succeeded in exploring the Moon with lower energy in 1991 utilizing perturbation of the Sun. In this paper, using the invariant manifolds of nonlinear 3-body systems, we constructed low energy transfer trajectories to the Moon. Along the method used by JPL research group, we approximated the Sun-Earth-Moon-spacecraft four-body system as two plane circular restricted there-body systems, and then presented more profound explanation for Hiten s trajectory in mathematics and dynamics. Considering the direction of the rotation of Earth-Moon L2 stable manifolds, we presented their structures and a more reasonable patching method, and obtained the position and velocity of the spacecraft at the launch point, and finally designed a trajectory which requires 12{\%} less velocity increment than traditional method. The results prove the feasibility and advantage of invariant manifolds of 3-body systems in designing and constructing trajectories from the Earth to the Moon.},

	Abstract = {A method to incorporate low-thrust propulsion into the invariant manifolds technique is presented in this paper. The low-thrust propulsion is introduced by means of special attainable sets that are used in conjunction with invariant manifolds to define a first-guess solution. This is later optimized in a more refined model where an optimal control formalism is used. Planar low-energy low-thrust transfers to the moon, as well as spatial low-thrust stable-manifold transfers to halo orbits in the Earth-moon system, are presented. These solutions are not achievable via patohed-conics methods or standard invariant manifolds techniques. The aim of the work is to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in delivering efficient solutions, which are compared with known examples.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the nonlinear closed- loop feedback control strategy for the spacecraft ren- dezvous problem with finite low thrust between libra- tion orbits in the Sun--Earth system. The model of spacecraft rendezvous takes the perturbations in ini- tial states, the actuator saturation limits, the measure- ment errors, and the external disturbance forces into consideration from an engineering point of view. The proposed nonlinear closed-loop feedback control strat- egy is not analytically explicit; rather, it is imple- mented by a rapid re-computation of the open-loop optimal control at each update instant. To guarantee the computational efficiency, a novel numerical algo- rithm for solving the open-loop optimal control is given. With the aid of the quasilinearization method, the open-loop optimal control problem is replaced successfully by a series of sparse symmetrical linear equations coupled with linear complementary problem, and the computational efficiency can be significantly increased. The numerical simulations of spacecraft rendezvous problems in the paper well demonstrate the robustness, high precision, and dominant real-time merits of the proposed closed-loop feedback control strategy.},

	Abstract = {The low-thrust spacecraft trajectory problem can be reduced to only a few parameters using calculus of variations and the well-known primer vector theory. This low dimensionality combined with the extraordinary speed of modern computers allows for rapid exploration of the parameter space and invites opportunities for global optimization. Accordingly, a general low-thrust trade analysis tool is developed based on a global search for local indirect method solutions. An efficient propagator is implemented with an implicit ``bang-bang'' thrusting structure that accommodates an a priori unknown number of switching times. An extension to the standard adjoint control transformation is introduced that provides additional physical insight and control over the anticipated evolution of the thrust profile. The uniformly random search enjoys a perfect linear speedup for parallel implementation. The method is applied specifically on multirevolution transfers in the Jupiter--Europa and Earth--moon restricted three body problems. In both cases, thousands of solutions are found in a single parallel run. The result is a global front of Pareto optimal solutions across the competing objectives of flight time and final mass.},

	Annote = {use of low-thrust transfers rather than impulsive manuevers

define attainable sets rather than the intersection of invariant manifolds

lots of good reference about low thrust and stable manifolds

earth escape velocity is less than the standard hyperbolic escape. referred to as ballistic escape by exploiting the sun/moon gravity fields

uses a restricted four body problem by treating the moon as a perturbing force in the three body system but equilibrium points, periodic orbits, and invariant manifolds disappear . loss of geometrical properties

sets defined that govern intersection of transfer/parking orbits

a thrust law is given in equation 12. increase velocity in heliocentric orbit then decrease energy when in the sun/mars regime

transfer is assumed complete when spacecraft reaches periapsis around mars. may not be in a mars orbit?

spacecraft trajectory is optimized within a full 4-body dynamical model of the system

optimization routine broken up into stages(earth depart, heliocentric, mars arrival) to avoid large distance changes

whole transfer trajectory is discretized

time intervals are chosen by hand and vary by regime (short near earth/mars and longer in the heliocentric phase)

	Abstract = {Preliminary designs of low-thrust transfer trajectories are developed in the Earth--moon three-body problem with variable specific impulse engines and fixed engine power. The solution for a complete time history of the thrust magnitude and direction is initially approached as a calculus of variations problem to locally maximize the final spacecraft mass. The problem is then solved directly by sequential quadratic programming, using either single or multiple shooting. The coasting phase along the transfer exploits invariant manifolds and, when possible, considers locations along the entire manifold surface for insertion. Such an approach allows for a nearly propellant-free final coasting phase along an arc selected from a family of known trajectories that contract to the periodic libration point orbit. This investigation includes transfer trajectories from an Earth parking orbit to some sample libration point trajectories, including L1 halo orbits, L1 and L2 vertical orbits, and L2 butterfly orbits. Given the availability of variable specific impulse engines in the future, this study indicates that fuel-efficient transfer trajectories could be used in future lunar missions, such as south pole communications satellite architectures.},

The low-thrust trajectory problem is formulated using techniques from calculus of variations, pa- rameter optimization, and differential dynamic programming. Primer vector theory provides the thrust profile as a feedback law, parameterized by the initial co-states. The first and second derivatives of var- ious penalty functions are derived from principles of static-dynamic control and dynamic programming. Both bang-bang/constant ejection velocity and variable specific impulse cases are considered, the former being complicated by the mapping of derivatives across switching times. A trust-region optimizer is then developed, where these derivatives are used to solve transfers between periodic orbits in the circular, restricted, three-body problem.},

	Abstract = {Ozimek, Martin T. M.S.A.A., Purdue University, December, 2006. A Low-Thrust Transfer Strategy to Earth-Moon Collinear Libration Point Orbits. Major Professor: Kathleen Howell.

A strategy to compute low-thrust transfer trajectories in the Earth-moon circular restricted three-body problem is developed. The dynamical model is formulated assuming variable specific impulse engines, an advanced finite-thrust propulsion model. Originating in an Earth parking orbit, the spacecraft is delivered to a location along the stable manifold; the engines power off and the spacecraft asymptotically approaches the periodic libration point orbit of interest. Elements of optimal control theory are used to derive a primer vector control law as well as a set of additional dependent variables that characterize the solution to the corresponding two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP). A hybrid direct/indirect method results in transfer trajectories that are associated with locally minimal propellant consumption. The generation of useful initial conditions is aided by an adjoint control transformation and a global ``shotgun'' method. The solution strategy is demonstrated in a detailed development of transfers to a 12-day L1 halo orbit, a 14-day L1 vertical orbit, and a 14-day L2 ``butterfly'' orbit. These target orbits are all selected from the families that meet line-of-sight coverage requirements in support of lunar south pole mission architecture.},

	Abstract = {Ozimek, Martin T. Ph.D., Purdue University, May 2010. Low-Thrust Trajectory Design and Optimization of Lunar South Pole Coverage Missions. Major Professor: Kathleen C. Howell.
A framework for designing and optimizing low-thrust trajectories for lunar south pole coverage missions is developed. Such missions may involve three, two, or even one satellite to maintain continuous communications between a lunar ground station and the Earth. Special emphasis is dedicated to single satellite communication links, which involve the design and discovery of novel pole-sitter orbits. Pole-sitters are pos- sible, given the availability of an efficient low-thrust force in the model. Low-thrust acceleration can be delivered in various forms; solar sails and electric propulsion en- gines are obvious examples. Low-thrust propulsion may also be employed to construct transfer trajectories to the coverage orbits of interest as well as end-of-life transfers. Additionally, a low-thrust thruster allows a spacecraft to shift between lunar cov- erage orbits. In this scenario, an optimal control-based approach is applicable for rapidly computing trajectories, however, in general, the many complexities involved in generating the trajectories are best solved with a direct transcription approach using collocation and mesh refinement. This general process is robust and allows for the inclusion of an unknown control history, path constraints, and the simulta- neous optimization of multiple phases while exploiting matrix sparsity for maximum computational efficiency. Even incorporating higher-fidelity dynamical effects, the pole-sitter solutions can be sustained as a long-duration option, using a solar sail, or as a temporary option in excess of one year on a small 500 kg spacecraft, using a solar electric propulsion engine comparable to existing technology.},

In this paper, we apply the dynamical systems techniques developed in our earlier work to reproduce systematically a Hiten-like mission. We approximate the Sun--Earth--Moon-spacecraft 4-body system as two 3-body systems. Using the invariant manifold structures of the Lagrange points of the 3-body systems, we are able to construct low energy transfer trajectories from the Earth which execute ballistic capture at the Moon. The techniques used in the design and construction of this trajectory may be applied in many situations.},

	Abstract = {This paper applies dynamical systems techniques to the problem of heteroclinic con- nections and resonance transitions in the planar circular restricted three-body problem. These related phenomena have been of concern for some time in topics such as the cap- ture of comets and asteroids and with the design of trajectories for space missions such as the Genesis Discovery Mission. The main new technical result in this paper is the numerical demonstration of the existence of a heteroclinic connection between pairs of periodic orbits, one around the libration point L1 and the other around L2, with the two periodic orbits having the same energy. This result is applied to the resonance transition problem and to the explicit numerical construction of interesting orbits with prescribed itineraries. The point of view developed in this paper is that the invariant manifold structures associated to L1 and L2 as well as the aforementioned heteroclinic connection are fundamental tools that can aid in understanding dynamical channels throughout the solar system as well as transport between the ``interior'' and ``exterior'' Hill's regions and other resonant phenomena.},

	Abstract = {In 1991, the Japanese Hiten mission used a low energy transfer with a ballistic capture at the Moon which required less ∆V than a standard Hohmann transfer to the Moon. In this paper, we apply the same dynamical systems techniques used to produce the ``Petit Grand Tour'' of Jovian moons to reproduce a Hiten-like mission. We decouple the Sun-Earth-Moon- Spacecraft 4-body problem into two 3-body problems. Using the invariant manifold theory of the Lagrange points of the 3-body systems, we are able to construct low energy transfer trajectories from the Earth and ballistic capture trajectories at the Moon. The techniques used in the design and construction of this trajectory may be applied in many situations.

	Abstract = {With an environment comparable to that of primordial Earth, a surface strewn with liquid hydrocarbon lakes, and an atmosphere denser than that of any other moon in the solar system, Saturn's largest moon Titan is a treasure trove of potential scien- tific discovery and is the target of a proposed NASA mission scheduled for launch in roughly one decade. A chief consideration associated with the design of any such mission is the constraint imposed by fuel limitations that accompany the spacecraft's journey between celestial bodies. In this study, we explore the use of patched three- body models in conjunction with a discrete mechanical optimization algorithm for the design of a fuel-efficient Saturnian moon tour focusing on Titan. In contrast to the use of traditional models for trajectory design such as the patched conic approx- imation, we exploit subtleties of the three-body problem, a classic problem from celestial mechanics that asks for the motion of three masses in space under mutual gravitational interaction, in order to slash fuel costs. In the process, we demonstrate the aptitude of the DMOC (Discrete Mechanics and Optimal Control) optimization algorithm in handling celestial mechanical trajectory optimization problems.

Mission design requires the efficient management of spacecraft fuel to reduce mis- sion cost, increase payload mass, and extend mission life. High efficiency, low-thrust propulsion devices potentially offer significant propellant reductions. Periodic orbits that exist in a multi-body regime and low-thrust transfers between these orbits can be applied in many potential mission scenarios, including scientific observation and communications missions as well as cargo transport. In light of the recent discov- ery of water ice in lunar craters, libration point orbits that support human missions within the Earth-Moon region are of particular interest. This investigation considers orbit transfer trajectories generated by a variable specific impulse, low-thrust engine with a primer-vector-based, fuel-optimizing transfer strategy. A multiple shooting procedure with analytical gradients yields rapid solutions and serves as the basis for an investigation into the trade space between flight time and consumption of fuel mass. Path and performance constraints can be included at node points along any thrust arc. Integration of invariant manifolds into the design strategy may also yield improved performance and greater fuel savings. The resultant transfers offer insight into the performance of the variable specific impulse engine and suggest novel im- plementations of conventional impulsive thrusters. Transfers incorporating invariant manifolds demonstrate the fuel savings and expand the mission design capabilities that are gained by exploiting system symmetry. A number of design applications are generated.},

	Abstract = {Vavrina, Matthew A. M.S.A.A., Purdue University, December, 2008. A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Approach to Global Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization. Major Professor: Kathleen C. Howell.

To expand mission capabilities that are required for exploration of the solar system, methodologies to design optimal low-thrust trajectories must be developed. However, low-thrust, multiple gravity-assist trajectories pose significant optimization challenges because of their expansive, multimodal design space. In this work, a technique is developed for global, low-thrust, interplanetary trajectory optimization through the hybridization of a genetic algorithm and a gradient-based direct method (GALLOP). The hybrid algorithm combines the effective global search capabilities of a genetic algorithm with the robust convergence and constraint handling of the local, calculus-based direct method. The automated approach alleviates the difficulty and biases of initial guess generation and provides near globally-optimal solutions. Both single objective and multiobjective implementations are developed. In the single objective implementation, the technique is applied to several complex low-thrust, gravity-assist trajectory scenarios, generating previously unpublished optimums. Specifically, the single objective hybrid algorithm generates apparent global optimums for a direct trajectory scenario to Mars, as well as gravity-assist trajectories with three intermediate flybys to Neptune and Pluto. The multiobjective implementation incorporates the NSGA-II algorithm to generate a Pareto front of solutions that are globally optimal in terms of both final delivered mass and time-of-flight in a single execution. The multiobjective hybrid algorithm is applied to a direct Earth-Mars rendezvous design scenario, successfully developing a Pareto front of near-globally optimal trajectories, enabling a tradeoff decision on the two objectives.},

The dif- ference among the three maneuvers mainly lie in the terminal constraint conditions. By the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, the trajectory optimization problem is converted into the two- point boundary-value problem, and the terminal constraint conditions of the three orbital maneuver missions are also investigated respectively. The single shooting method is used to solve the corresponding boundary-value problem, and the simulations show that the product of the minimum flight time and the maximal thrust is near constant in the three maneuver problems.},

	Abstract = {A gyrostat [1] is a mechanical system S which consists of a solid body \{S1\} and other bodies \{S2\} which are connected to it. These other bodies are either variable or solid, but their motion relative to the body \{S1\} does not alter the geometry of the mass system S. Examples of such systems are: a solid body to which there are connected axes of several (or of one) symmetric gyroscopes: or a solid body with a cavity of arbitrary shape entirely filled with a homogeneous liquid; and similar systems. It is obvious that for a given distribution of masses in a gyrostat no change can occur in the position of the center of gravity of the principal axes and of the moments of inertia of the gyrostat with respect to any point of the solid body \{S1\} as the result of the internal motion of the bodies S2. In the present work there is investigated, by the use of the second method of Liapunov, the stability of certain motions of heavy gyrostats with one fixed point. },

@article{welch2006,
	Abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers & results.},

@article{lucking2010,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for the orbit control of high area-to-mass ratio spacecraft, such as spacecraft-on-a-chip, future smart dust devices and inflatable spacecraft. By changing the reflectivity coefficient of an electrochromic coating of the spacecraft, the perturbing effect of solar radiation pressure (SRP) is exploited to enable long-lived orbits and to control formations, without the need for propellant consumption or active pointing. The spacecraft is coated with a thin film of an electrochromic material that changes its reflectivity coefficient when a small current is applied. The change of reflectance alters the fraction of the radiation pressure force that is transmitted to the satellite, and hence has a direct effect on the spacecraft orbit evolution. The orbital element space is analysed to identify orbits which can be stabilised with electrochromic orbit control. A closed-loop feedback control method using an artificial potential field approach is introduced to stabilise these otherwise unsteady orbits. The stability of this solution is analysed and verified through numerical simulation. Finally, a test case is simulated in which the control method is used to perform orbital manoeuvres for a spacecraft formation.},
