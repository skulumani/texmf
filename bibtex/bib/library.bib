  abstract      = {The mass extinction at the K/P (Cretaceous--Paleogene) boundary was caused by an extraterrestrial impact and the following abrupt climate/environment change. In this study, numerical simulations of asteroid/comet impact on the oceanic crust of the earth are carried out by using the hydrocode AUTODYN-2D (ANSYS, Inc.). The objective of this work is to estimate how much impact debris is ejected into the atmosphere. Therefore the accumulations of ejected mass originating from different sources were calculated as functions of time at different altitudes. It is found that about 50 tera-tons of seawater and 35 tera-tons of crust are ejected when a 10 km diameter asteroid collides on the Earth with the speed of 20 km/s. The values increase to 240 and 175 tera-tons when the asteroid diameter is increased to 20 km. It is also demonstrated that a typical comet disintegrates and bounces back into the atmosphere due to small density, while much heavier asteroids do not recoil much.},

  abstract      = {The chances that Earth will collide with a significant near earth object (NEO) within the next century are very small, but such a collision is possible, would be catastrophic, and could happen at any time. Much discussion has been devoted to methods of diverting these objects away from Earth through the use of space technology. However, if these efforts are unsuccessful, we would need to implement effective strategies to survive the event, no matter how cataclysmic. To date, disaster management for various impact scenarios has not been addressed (except in novels and Hollywood films). An impact disaster may be many orders of magnitude greater than any disaster the human species has ever experienced. Initially, technology and experience gained in other large-scale disasters will most likely form the foundation of how these impact events will be managed and classified. Given the size and energy of the projectile, the estimated area of damage, and whether impact effects might be localized or global in nature, we can begin to build basic disaster response scenarios, anticipate public health concerns, and formulate questions in need of answers. Questions we must deal with include: what will be required technologically, sociologically, and medically to survive? What types of evacuation plans and warning systems might be required? Capabilities in need of further investigation include: technological protection strategies related to `impact winter', expanded chemical hazard control methodologies, food storage and production, roles of national governments, and international cooperation. Whatever the magnitude and severity of the event, we must reflect on what we know, what capabilities we can apply, develop or adapt, and seriously investigate what might be done to manage it and survive.},

  abstract      = {Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) have struck the Earth throughout its existence. During epochs when life was gaining a foothold $\sim$4 Ga, the impact rate was thousands of times what it is today. Even during the Phanerozoic, the numbers of NEAs guarantee that there were other impacts, possibly larger than the Chicxulub event, which was responsible for the Cretaceous--Tertiary extinctions. Astronomers have found over 2500 NEAs of all sizes, including well over half of the estimated 1100 NEAs $>$1 km diameter. NEAs are mostly collisional fragments from the inner half of the asteroid belt and range in composition from porous, carbonaceous-chondrite-like to metallic. Nearly one-fifth of them have satellites or are double bodies. When the international telescopic Spaceguard Survey, which has a goal of discovering 90% of NEAs $>$1 km diameter, is completed, perhaps as early as 2008, nearly half of the remaining impact hazard will be from land or ocean impacts by bodies 70--600 m diameter. (Comets are expected to contribute only about 1% of the total risk.) The consequences of impacts for civilization are potentially enormous, but impacts are so rare that worldwide mortality from impacts will have dropped to only about 150 per year (averaged over very long durations) after the Spaceguard goal has, presumably, ruled out near-term impacts by 90% of the most dangerous ones; that is, in the mid-range between very serious causes of death (disease, auto accidents) and minor but frightening ones (like shark attacks). Differences in perception concerning this rather newly recognized hazard dominate evaluation of its significance. The most likely type of impact events we face are hyped or misinterpreted predicted impacts or near-misses involving small NEAs.},

Popova et al. (p. 1069, published online 7 November; see the Perspective by Chapman) provide a comprehensive description of this event and of the body that caused it, including detailed information on the asteroid orbit and atmospheric trajectory, damage assessment, and meteorite recovery and characterization. The asteroid impact near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on 15 February 2013 was the largest airburst on Earth since the 1908 Tunguska event, causing a natural disaster in an area with a population exceeding one million. Because it occurred in an era with modern consumer electronics, field sensors, and laboratory techniques, unprecedented measurements were made of the impact event and the meteoroid that caused it. Here, we document the account of what happened, as understood now, using comprehensive data obtained from astronomy, planetary science, geophysics, meteorology, meteoritics, and cosmochemistry and from social science surveys. A good understanding of the Chelyabinsk incident provides an opportunity to calibrate the event, with implications for the study of near-Earth objects and developing hazard mitigation strategies for planetary protection.},

  abstract      = {Several questions in the statistical mechanics of non-Hamiltonian systems are discussed. The theory of differential forms on the phase space manifold is applied to provide a fully covariant formulation of the generalized Liouville equation. The properties of invariant volume elements are considered, and the nonexistence in general of smooth invariant measures noted. The time evolution of the generalized Gibbs entropy associated with a given choice of volume form is studied, and conditions under which the entropy is constant are discussed. For non-Hamiltonian systems on manifolds with a metric tensor compatible with the flow, it is shown that the associated metric factor is in general a time-dependent solution of the generalized Liouville equation.},

  abstract      = {Relative equilibria of a dumbbell-type spacecraft consisting of two bodies separated by an elastic link is studied in a central gravitational field. The only other forces present in the system are two internal forces acting on the spacecraft to control its attitude and its shape. Linearized equations from the Routh reduction technique are derived. These are used to demonstrate the local controllability properties for the attitude, shape, and orbital equations of the dumbbell spacecraft. Stability conditions of the relative equilibria are determined and then analyzed through examples. The effects of the gravity gradient, and the coupling between attitude, shape, and orbital dynamics, can be used to change the energy of the spacecraft. Thus, through control of the attitude and/or shape, the orbit of the spacecraft can be modified with minimal fuel expenditure},

  abstract      = {An elastic dumbbell spacecraft is assumed to consist of two identical mass particles that are connected by a long elastic link. The motion of the dumbbell spacecraft can be described by orbit, attitude and shape dynamics that arise due to gravitational forces, an elastic restoring force along the longitudinal axis of the spacecraft, and control forces that act to change the attitude and shape of the spacecraft. These control forces have the property that there is no net external force on the dumbbell spacecraft. Since the angular momentum of the spacecraft is necessarily conserved, Routh reduced equations of motion are developed that describe the reduced dynamics of the controlled spacecraft. The reduced equations of motion are developed; relative equilibria are determined, and simplified reduced equations, in a linear form, are obtained. These linear reduced equations demonstrate spacecraft controllability properties. It is shown that certain maneuvers, involving a change in orbit, can be accomplished using only attitude and shape control inputs. The proposed framework can be used to study this propulsion force approach to orbital maneuvers.},

We show that the Newton-Euler equations of motion are Hamiltonian with respect to a certain non-canonical structure. The system possesses natural symmetries. Using them we shown how to perform reduction of the number of degrees of freedom. We prove that on every stage of this process equations of motion are Hamiltonian and we give explicite form corresponding of non-canonical Poisson bracket. We also discuss practical consequences of the reduction. We prove the existence of 36 non-Lagrangean relative equilibria for two generic rigid bodies. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach allows to simplify the general form of the mutual potential of two rigid bodies.},

Advantage is taken of the decoupling between inplane-pitch and roll-yaw out-of-plane motion to restrict the motion to the orbital plane by an appropriate choice ofinitial conditions. An averaged solution to the nonlinear inplane-pitch equations whose accuracy is determined by ignoring terms of order {\{}$\epsilon${\textperiodcentered}G32/a2, $\epsilon$2,$\alpha\epsilon$2,G32/a2{\}} and higher is presented. The results show that the near-resonant motion is characterized by a periodic interchange of energy between the attitude and orbital motion.},

  abstract      = {Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to describe the general setting for the application of techniques from geometric mechanics and dynamical systems to the problem of asteroid pairs. The paper also gives some preliminary results on transport calculations and the associated problem of calculating binary asteroid escape rates. The dynamics of an asteroid pair, consisting of two irregularly shaped asteroids interacting through their gravitational potential is an example of a full-body problem or FBP in which two or more extended bodies interact. One of the interesting features of the binary asteroid problem is that there is coupling between their translational and rotational degrees of freedom. General FBPs have a wide range of other interesting aspects as well, including the 6-DOF guidance, control, and dynamics of vehicles, the dynamics of interacting or ionizing molecules, the evolution of small body, planetary, or stellar systems, and almost any other problem in which distributed bodies interact with each other or with an external field. This paper focuses on the specific case of asteroid pairs using techniques that are generally applicable to many other FBPs. This particular full two-body problem (F2BP) concerns the dynamical evolution of two rigid bodies mutually interacting via a gravitational field. Motivation comes from planetary science, where these interactions play a key role in the evolution of asteroid rotation states and binary asteroid systems. The techniques that are applied to this problem fall into two main categories. The first is the use of geometric mechanics to obtain a description of the reduced phase space, which opens the door to a number of powerful techniques, such as the energy-momentum method for determining the stability of equilibria and the use of variational integrators for greater accuracy in simulation. Second, techniques from computational dynamic systems are used to determine phase space structures that are important for transport phenomena and dynamic evolution.},

  abstract      = {The population of space objects (SOs) is tracked with sparse resources and thus tracking data are only collected on these objects for a relatively small fraction of their orbit revolution (i.e., a short arc). This contributes to commonly mistagged or uncorrelated SOs and their associated trajectory uncertainties (covariances) to be less physically meaningful. The case of simply updating a catalogued SO is not treated here, but rather, the problem of reducing a set of collected short-arc data on an arbitrary deep space object without a priori information, and from the observations alone, determining its orbit to an acceptable level of accuracy. Fundamentally, this is a problem of data association and track correlation. The work presented here takes the concept of admissible regions and attributable vectors along with a multiple hypothesis filtering approach to determine how well these SO orbits can be recovered for short-arc data in near realtime and autonomously. While the methods presented here are explored with synthetic data, the basis for the simulations resides in actual data that has yet to be reduced, but whose characteristics are replicated as well as possible to yield results that can be expected using actual data.},

Except in the linear Gaussian case, it is extremely difficult to determine this density function. In this paper an approximation that permits the explicit calculation of the a posteriori density from the Bayesian recursion relations is discussed and applied to the solution of the nonlinear filtering problem. In particular, it is noted that a weighted sum of Gaussian probability density functions can be used to approximate arbitrarily closely another density function. This representation provides the basis for procedure that is developed and discussed.},

Duke University's Talent Identification Program (TIP) identified 259 young adolescents who were equally gifted. By age 40, their life accomplishments also were extraordinary: Thirty-seven percent had earned doctorates, 7.5% had achieved academic tenure (4.3% at research-intensive universities), and 9% held patents; many were high-level leaders in major organizations. As was the case for the SMPY sample before them, differential ability strengths predicted their contrasting and eventual developmental trajectories---even though essentially all participants possessed both mathematical and verbal reasoning abilities far superior to those of typical Ph.D. recipients. Individuals, even profoundly gifted ones, primarily do what they are best at. Differences in ability patterns, like differences in interests, guide development along different paths, but ability level, coupled with commitment, determines whether and the extent to which noteworthy accomplishments are reached if opportunity presents itself.},

First, the small body dynamic equation is deduced in the landing site coordinate system. Second, the desired trajectory is planned in the condition of safe soft landing constraints. Third, the guidance law based on \{VSC\} is designed to track the desired trajectory and succeed in landing on the surface of small body. Finally, the guidance and control algorithm is formed and the effectiveness of algorithm is verified by numerical Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we review the recent results on stability and control for time-varying sets of nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and utilize them for the problem of multi-vehicle coordinated motion in the context of obstacle avoidance where obstacles are approximated and enclosed by elliptic shapes. Specifically, we design distributed controllers for individual vehicles moving in a specified formation in the presence of such obstacles. The obstacle avoidance algorithm that we propose is based on transitional trajectories which are denned by a set of ordinary differential equations that exhibit a stable elliptical limit cycle. The control framework is implemented on the system of double integrators and is shown to globally exponentially stabilize moving formation of the agents in pursuit of a leader while ensuring obstacle avoidance.},

  abstract      = {Using Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptive backstepping controller is presented in this paper for optimal descent tracking. Unlike the traditional approach, the proposed control law can cope with input saturation and failure which enables the embedded autonomy of lander system. In addition, this control law can also restrain the unknown bounded terms (i.e., disturbance). To show the controller's performance in the presence of input saturation, input failure and bounded external disturbance, simulation was carried out under a lunar landing scenario.},

Presents a sliding mode controller for rendezvous with a celestial object

## Assumptions

* Only treats translational dynamics
* Kinematics described in terms of a spherical coordinate representation
* Two body gravitational model
* Exponential drag model and matched uncertainties are treated as external disturbances

## Issues

* Due to spherical coordinate representation they did not consider the approach from a different direction
* Fairly standard SMC application
* Stability/region of attraciton proof not fully developed
* Only allows for a bounded tracking 
* Assumes a stationary target (nonrotating asteroid)},

  abstract      = {The paper offers a comprehensive study of the motion in a central force field with respect to a rotating non-inertial reference frame. It is called Foucault Pendulum-like motion and it is a generalization of a classic Theoretical Mechanics problem. A closed form vectorial solution to this famous problem is presented. The vectorial time-explicit solution for the classic Foucault Pendulum problem is obtained as a particular case of the considerations made in the present approach. New interesting conservation laws for the Foucault Pendulum-like motion are deduced by using simple differential and vectorial computations. They help to visualize the shape of the trajectories. Exact vectorial expressions for the law of motion and the velocity are also offered. The case of the driven Foucault Pendulum is also analyzed, and a closed form solution is deduced based on the general considerations. In the end, an new tensorial prime integral for the Foucault Pendulum problem is offered. It helps to reveal in a concise form, within a single entity, all the scalar and vectorial conservation laws for the Foucault Pendulum motion. Two important engineering applications to this approach are presented: the motion of a satellite with respect to a rotating reference frame and the Keplerian relative orbital motion. The latter has a great importance in modeling the problems concerning satellite formation flying, satellite constellations and space terminal rendezvous. The classic problem of the harmonic oscillator in an electromagnetic field is also solved by using the instruments presented in this paper.},

  abstract      = {Introduction.\hspace{0.5em} The duration of the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) may give rise to subjective complaints of premature ejaculation (PE) and is usually determined by self-assessment or by stopwatch.Aim.\hspace{0.5em} The aim of this study was to investigate the IELT distribution in the general male population and the accuracy of IELT assessment by using a blinded timer device instead of a stopwatch, thereby minimizing possible interference with the spontaneous and natural way of having intercourse.Methods.\hspace{0.5em} The IELT was measured with a timer device during 4 weeks in a nonselected sample of 474 men from The Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, Turkey, and the United States. Questionnaires were administered before and after the 4-week IELT assessments.Main Outcome Measures.\hspace{0.5em} IELT; erectile function dysfunction score of International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF).Results.\hspace{0.5em} The IELT had a positively skewed distribution, with a geometric mean of 5.7 minutes and a median of 6.0 minutes (range: 0.1--52.1 minutes). Men from Turkey had the shortest median IELT (4.4 minutes). Men from the United Kingdom had the longest IELT (10.0 minutes). Circumcision and condom use had no significant impact on the median IELT. Subjects who were discontent with their latency time had slightly lower median IELT values of 5.2 minutes than the median of the population.Conclusion.\hspace{0.5em} The IELT distribution, measured with a blinded timer device, is very similar to the IELT distribution of our previous population survey which utilized a stopwatch. In the general male population, complaints of discontent with self-perceived latency had a slightly lower median IELT value than the median of the overall population.

  abstract      = {Some ants have an extraordinary social organization, called unicoloniality, whereby individuals mix freely among physically separated nests. This type of social organization is not only a key attribute responsible for the ecological domination of these ants, but also an evolutionary paradox and a potential problem for kin selection theory because relatedness between nest mates is effectively zero. The introduction of the Argentine ant in Europe was apparently accompanied by a dramatic loss of inter-nest aggression and the formation of two immense supercolonies (which effectively are two unicolonial populations). Introduced populations experienced only limited loss of genetic diversity at neutral markers, indicating that the breakdown of recognition ability is unlikely to be merely due to a genetic bottleneck. Rather, we suggest that a ``genetic cleansing'' of recognition cues occurred after introduction. Indeed workers of the same supercolony are never aggressive to each other despite the large geographical distance and considerable genetic differentiation between sampling sites. By contrast, aggression is invariably extremely high between the two supercolonies, indicating that they have become fixed for different recognition alleles.

  abstract      = {Abstract An intercept mission with nuclear explosives is the most effective of the practical mitigation options against the impact threat of near-Earth objects (NEOs) with a short warning time (e.g., much less than 10 years). The existing penetrated subsurface nuclear explosion technology limits the intercept velocity to less than approximately 300 m/s. Consequently, an innovative concept of blending a hypervelocity kinetic impactor with a subsurface nuclear explosion has been developed for optimal penetration, fragmentation, and dispersion of the target NEO. A proposed hypervelocity asteroid intercept vehicle (HAIV) consists of a kinetic-impact leader spacecraft and a follower spacecraft carrying nuclear explosives. This paper describes the conceptual development and design of a baseline \{HAIV\} system and its flight validation mission architecture for three mission cost classifications (e.g., $500 M, $1 B, and $1.5 B).},

  abstract      = {This paper describes a method of recovering linear controllability of an underactuated spacecraft by accounting for the effects of solar radiation pressure (SRP) in the spacecraft attitude dynamics model. The developments are based on a spacecraft model with a four wheel reaction wheel array of which two wheels have failed and two wheels are functioning. The model for SRP torque as a function of spacecraft attitude is incorporated into the state-space description of the system. Under suitable assumptions, the linearization of the underacted spacecraft model (with SRP effects included) is shown to be linearly controllable. This conclusion is exploited to define a novel approach for handling reaction wheel failures based on conventional Linear Quadratic (LQ) controllers. The results of the linear and non-linear simulations illustrate the ability to recover pointing by controlling two functioning reaction wheels while two other wheels undergo subsequent failures.},

  abstract      = {Ants are among the most damaging invasive species, and their success frequently arises from the widespread cooperation displayed by introduced populations, often across hundreds of kilometers. Previous studies of the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) have shown that introduced populations on different continents each contain a single, vast supercolony and, occasionally, smaller secondary colonies. Here, we perform inter-continental behavioral analyses among supercolonies in North America, Europe, Asia, Hawaii, New Zealand and Australia and show that these far-flung supercolonies also recognize and accept each other as if members of a single, globally distributed supercolony. Furthermore, populations also possess similar genetic and chemical profiles. However, these ants do show aggression toward ants from South Africa and the smaller secondary colonies that occur in Hawaii and California. Thus, the largest and most dominant introduced populations are likely descended from the same ancestral colony and, despite having been established more than 100 years ago, have diverged very little. This apparent evolutionary stasis is surprising because, in other species, some of the most rapid rates of evolutionary change have occurred in introduced populations. Given the spatial extent of the Argentine ant society we report here, there can be little doubt that this intercontinental supercolony represents the most populous known animal society.},

  journal       = {Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society},
  year          = {2014},
  abstract      = {One of the techniques used in the past decade to determine the shape with a good accuracy and estimate certain physical features (volume, mass, moments of inertia) of asteroids is the polyhedral model method. We rebuild the shape of the asteroid 433 Eros using data from 1998 December observations of the probe Near-Earth-Asteroid-Rendezvous-Shoemaker. In our computations, we use a code that avoids singularities from the line integrals of a homogeneous arbitrary shaped polyhedral source. This code evaluates the gravitational potential function and its first- and second-order derivatives. Taking the rotation of asteroid 433 Eros into consideration, the aim of this work is to analyse the dynamics of numerical simulations of 3D initially equatorial orbits near the body. We find that the minimum radius for direct, equatorial circular orbits that cannot impact with the Eros surface is 36\hspace{0.167em}km and the minimum radius for stable orbits is 31\hspace{0.167em}km despite significant perturbations of its orbit. Moreover, as the orbits suffer less perturbations due to the irregular gravitational potential of Eros in the elliptic case, the most significant result of the analysis is that stable orbits exist at a periapsis radius of 29\hspace{0.167em}km for initial eccentricities ei $\leq$ 0.2.},

The mechanism of regularization with Birkhoff coordinates and with theenergy differential equation is described. Then the initial conditions for collision orbits are established. The theory is illustrated with the description of a new family of symmetric periodic collision orbits. It is shown how this family is related to the work of Moulton, Darwin and Stromgren in the circular restricted problem, and also to the Earth-Moon mass ratio. In the high eccentricity ranges, some relations with the triple collision problem are pointed out. The differential corrections have been made with an automatic search technique which is described in the appendix.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents a method to construct optimal transfers between unstable periodic orbits of differing energies using invariant manifolds. The transfers constructed in this method asymptotically depart the initial orbit on a trajectory contained within the unstable manifold of the initial orbit and later, asymptotically arrive at the final orbit on a trajectory contained within the stable manifold of the final orbit. Primer vector theory is applied to a transfer to determine the optimal maneuvers required to create the bridging trajectory that connects the unstable and stable manifold trajectories. Transfers are constructed between unstable periodic orbits in the Sun--Earth, Earth--Moon, and Jupiter-Europa three-body systems. Multiple solutions are found between the same initial and final orbits, where certain solutions retrace interior portions of the trajectory. All transfers created satisfy the conditions for optimality. The costs of transfers constructed using manifolds are compared to the costs of transfers constructed without the use of manifolds. In all cases, the total cost of the transfer is significantly lower when invariant manifolds are used in the transfer construction. In many cases, the transfers that employ invariant manifolds are three times more efficient, in terms of fuel expenditure, than the transfer that do not. The decrease in transfer cost is accompanied by an increase in transfer time of flight.},

  abstract      = {Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) is an excellent method to stabilize mechanical systems in the Hamiltonian formalism. In this paper, several improvements are made on the IDA-PBC method. The skew-symmetric interconnection submatrix in the conventional form of IDA-PBC is shown to have some redundancy for systems with the number of degrees of freedom greater than two, containing unnecessary components that do not contribute to the dynamics. To completely remove this redundancy, the use of quadratic gyroscopic forces is proposed in place of the skew-symmetric interconnection submatrix. Reduction of the number of matching partial differential equations in IDA-PBC and simplification of the structure of the matching partial differential equations are achieved by eliminating the gyroscopic force from the matching partial differential equations. In addition, easily verifiable criteria are provided for Lyapunov/exponential stabilizability by IDA-PBC for all linear controlled Hamiltonian systems with arbitrary degrees of underactuation and for all nonlinear controlled Hamiltonian systems with one degree of underactuation. A general design procedure for IDA-PBC is given and illustrated with examples. The duality of the new IDA-PBC method to the method of controlled Lagrangians is discussed. This paper renders the IDA-PBC method as powerful as the controlled Lagrangian method.},

  abstract      = {Data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (~300,000 galaxies) indicate that recent star formation (within the last 1 billion years) is bimodal: half of the stars form from gas with high amounts of metals (solar metallicity) and the other half form with small contribution of elements heavier than helium (~10%-30% solar). Theoretical studies of mass loss from the brightest stars derive significantly higher stellar-origin black hole (BH) masses (~30-80 M Sun ) than previously estimated for sub-solar compositions. We combine these findings to estimate the probability of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) arising from the inspiral of double compact objects. Our results show that a low-metallicity environment significantly boosts the formation of double compact object binaries with at least one BH. In particular, we find the GW detection rate is increased by a factor of 20 if the metallicity is decreased from solar (as in all previous estimates) to a 50-50 mixture of solar and 10% solar metallicity. The current sensitivity of the two largest instruments to neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) binary inspirals (VIRGO: ~9 Mpc; LIGO: ~18) is not high enough to ensure a first detection. However, our results indicate that if a future instrument increased the sensitivity to ~50-100 Mpc, a detection of GWs would be expected within the first year of observation. It was previously thought that NS-NS inspirals were the most likely source for GW detection. Our results indicate that BH-BH binaries are ~25 times more likely sources than NS-NS systems and that we are on the cusp of GW detection.},

In this report I present a new geometrical approach for modeling and understanding various abstract, natural, and man-made shapes. Starting from the concept of the circle, I show that a large variety of shapes can be described by a single and simple geometrical equation, the Superformula. Modification of the parameters permits the generation of various natural polygons. For example, applying the equation to logarithmic or trigonometric functions modifies the metrics of these functions and all associated graphs. As a unifying framework, all these shapes are proven to be circles in their internal metrics, and the Superformula provides the precise mathematical relation between Euclidean measurements and the internal non-Euclidean metrics of shapes. Looking beyond Euclidean circles and Pythagorean measures reveals a novel and powerful way to study natural forms and phenomena.},

  abstract      = {This dissertation studies the orbital motion of a spacecraft about a rotating second degree and order gravity field, with its main application to orbital motion about uniformly rotating, irregular-shape asteroids. Such dynamical systems are non-integrable in general. Our goal is to understand how the orbital dynamics change as a function of the central body's rotation rate and mass distribution. To carry out this analysis we use three different approaches: averaging, resonance analysis, and periodic orbit computation. By using these analyses, we can better understand the character of a spacecraft's motion around an asteroid, which is much different from spacecraft motion around the Earth or other planets in the Solar system. Specifically, the main contributions of this dissertation are as follows. First a definition for size-shape stability of orbital motion is proposed and two facts are presented, which are related to the orbital stability of spacecraft motion in the rotating second degree and order gravity field. Second, the secular motions of a spacecraft are studied for three cases: when the central body does not rotate, rotates slowly, and rotates rapidly. The averaged Lagrange equations are derived and analyzed for these cases. Third, the short-period motions related to resonance are analyzed using the elliptic expansions of semi-major axis and eccentricity, and averaging near a resonance between the asteroid rotational and orbital motion. Fourth, periodic orbits are studied, including search methods, existence and stability analyses; five basic families of periodic orbits are found. Finally, a summary of the results in this dissertation is given, and their relations to our size-shape stability definition are discussed.},

A normalized form of the equations of motion are derived and analyzed. A numerical stability criteria is proposed and used to evaluate the stability of initially near-circular orbits in the equatorial plane of the body.

  abstract      = {This paper proposes a computational method to solve constrained cooperative motion planning problems for multiple vehicles undergoing translational and rotational motions. The problem is solved by means of the Lie group projection operator approach, a recently developed optimization strategy for solving continuous-time optimal control problems on Lie groups. State constraints (for collision avoidance) are handled by means of a set of barrier functions, turning the optimization approach into an interior point method. A sample computation is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract      = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses `value networks'to evaluate board positions and `policy networks'to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, a fast solver for the optimization problem arising in the nonlinear model predictive control of spacecraft attitude is developed and simulation results of its application to constrained spacecraft attitude control are presented. The solver exploits the numerical solution of the necessary conditions for optimality in a discrete-time optimal control problem defined over a prediction horizon, where the discrete-time dynamics are based on the Lie group variational integrator model. The inequality constraints (thrust constraint, inclusion/exclusion zone constraints, etc.) are handled using a penalty function approach. Our developments exploit the geometric mechanics and control formalism.},

  abstract      = {Recent analyses have shown that distant orbits within the scattered disk population of the Kuiper Belt exhibit an unexpected clustering in their respective arguments of perihelion. While several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can successfully account for the observations remains elusive. In this work we show that the orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) cluster not only in argument of perihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such a clustering has only a probability of 0.007% to be due to chance, thus requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass $\gtrsim$10 m $\oplus$ whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the distant KBOs, but whose perihelion is 180$\,^{\circ}$ away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed orbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the presence of high-perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60$\,^{\circ}$ and 150$\,^{\circ}$ whose origin was previously unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and highly inclined outer solar system objects provides the opportunity for testing our hypothesis as well as further constraining the orbital elements and mass of the distant planet.},

  abstract      = {The restricted three-body problem is considered for values of the Jacobi constant C near the value \{C2\} associated to the Euler critical point L2. A Lyapunov family of periodic orbits near L2, the so-called family (c), is born for C = \{C2\} and exists for values of C less than C2. These periodic orbits are hyperbolic. The corresponding invariant manifolds meet transversally along homoclinic orbits. In this paper the variation of the transversality is analyzed as a function of the Jacobi constant C and of the mass parameter $\mu$. Asymptotical expressions of the invariant manifolds for C $\lesssim$ \{C2\} and $\mu$ $\gtrsim$ 0 are found. Several numerical experiments provide accurate information for the manifolds and a good agreement is found with the asymptotical expressions. Symbolic dynamic techniques are used to show the existence of a large class of motions. In particular the existence of orbits passing in a random way (in a given sense) from the region near one primary to the region near the other is proved.},

  abstract            = {This paper presents a new geometric adaptive control system with state inequality constraints for the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. The control system is designed such that the desired attitude is asymptotically stabilized, while the controlled attitude trajectory avoids undesired regions defined by an inequality constraint. In addition, we develop an adaptive update law that enables attitude stabilization in the presence of unknown disturbances. The attitude dynamics and the proposed control systems are developed on the special orthogonal group such that singularities and ambiguities of other attitude parameterizations, such as Euler angles and quaternions are completely avoided. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental results.},

* OD estimated the following parameters:
  * Spacecraft state
  * Asteriod attitude
  * Asteroid emphemeris
  * Solar pressure
  * Landmark locations
  * Measurement biases
  * Spacecraft manuevers
  * Erors physical parameters: mass, MOI, gravity harmonics
* Shape model is generated by processing optical landmarks and laser altimetry data
* Integrate shape over entire volume and assume constant density. Compare with true gravity field to get idea of internal structure
* Track features across images from MSI camera. Provides accuracy for OD at resolution of camera ~ meter level
* Shape generated after getting a good filtered solution of spacecraft trajectory and then processing the laser range finder data
* Shape model accuracy on the order of 50-100m accuracy when compared to landmark tracking of images},

  abstract      = {Space trajectory design is often achieved through a combination of dynamical systems theory and optimal control. The union of trajectory design techniques utilizing invariant manifolds of the planar circular restricted three-body problem and the optimal control scheme Discrete Mechanics and Optimal Control (DMOC) facilitates the design of low-energy trajectories in the N-body problem. In particular, DMOC is used to optimize a trajectory from the Earth to the Moon in the 4-body problem, removing the mid-course change in velocity usually necessary for such a trajectory while still exploiting the structure from the invariant manifolds. This thesis also focuses on how to adapt DMOC, a method devised with a constant step size, for the highly nonlinear dynamics involved in trajectory design. Mesh refinement techniques that aim to reduce discretization errors in the solution and energy evolution and their effect on DMOC optimization are explored and compared with trajectories created using time adaptive variational integrators. Furthermore, a time adaptive form of DMOC is developed that allows for a variable step size that is updated throughout the optimization process. Time adapted DMOC is based on a discretization of Hamilton's principle applied to the time adapted Lagrangian of the optimal control problem. Variations of the discrete action of the optimal control Lagrangian lead to discrete Euler-Lagrange equations that can be enforced as constraints for a boundary value problem. This new form of DMOC leads to the accurate and efficient solution of optimal control problems with highly nonlinear dynamics. Time adapted DMOC is tested on several space trajectory problems including the elliptical orbit transfer in the 2-body problem and the reconfiguration of a cubesat.},

  abstract      = {We develop nonlinear reference governor and nonlinear model predictive control schemes for constrained spacecraft attitude control. The schemes use the nonlinear discrete-time model of spacecraft dynamics based on the Lie group variational integrator evolving on SO(3) $\times$ SO(3). The reference governor is a computationally simpler add-on to the nominal controller, while the model predictive controller provides faster response and better performance. The stability properties and constrained domains of attraction of these schemes are analyzed and their capability to perform global rest-to-rest reorientation maneuvers is established. Simulation results are reported where controllers perform specified reorientation maneuvers while adhering to torque and inclusion zone constraints.},

  abstract      = {This paper develops a control methodology that unifies control barrier functions and control Lyapunov functions through quadratic programs. The result is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control, which presents both safety and performance considerations, as well as actuator bounds. We begin by presenting a novel notion of a barrier function associated with a set, formulated in the context of Lyapunov-like conditions; the existence of a barrier function satisfying these conditions implies forward invariance of the set. This formulation naturally yields a notion of control barrier function (CBF), yielding inequality constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the simultaneous achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). These formulations are illustrated in the context of adaptive cruise control, where the control objective of achieving a desired speed is balanced by the minimum following conditions on a lead car and force-based constraints on acceleration and braking.},

 functions-for three-axis attitude reorientation for a rigid body
 spacecraft in presence of multiple constraints. In this direction, two
 types of attitude constrained zones are first defined, namely, the
 attitude forbidden and mandatory zones. The paper then utilizes a convex
 parameterization of forbidden and mandatory zones for constructing a
 logarithmic barrier potential function that is subsequently used for the
 synthesis of the attitude control laws. The feasible controller-which
 uses the feedback of the unit quaternions in the context of the proposed
 methodology- is then implemented using a modified integrator
 backstepping method in order to compromise the actuator saturations. The
 paper concludes with a set of simulation results in order to evaluate
 the effectiveness, and demonstrate the viability, of the proposed
 methodology.}},

  abstract      = {Barrier methods for constrained optimization, widely applied in the 1960s and 1970s, have recently enjoyed a revival of popularity. A line search with respect to a logarithmic barrier function or related potential function is often part of modern interior methods. Standard line search procedures tend to be inefficient in this context for two reasons; an inappropriate choice of initial trial step if any constraints are nonlinear, and poor approximation of the barrier function by loworder polynomial interpolants. This paper discusses line search strategies specifically designed for the logarithmic barrier function.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents four types of tracking control systems for the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. First, a smooth control system is constructed to follow a given desired attitude trajectory, while guaranteeing almost semi-global exponential stability. It is generalized to achieve global exponential stability by using a hybrid control scheme based on multiple configuration error functions. They are further extended to obtain robustness with respect to a fixed disturbance using an integral term. The resulting robust, global exponential stability for attitude tracking is the unique contribution of this paper.},

  abstract      = {The formation relative motion control by using one body fixed thruster and reaction wheels is a challenging problem due to the coupled translational and rotational dynamics. As the thruster vector depends on the current attitude and its angular velocity, and some of the attitude constraints also couple the position and attitude of the spacecraft, it makes the formation control problem high dimensional. This paper develops two decoupling conditions, including thrust vector maneuverability condition and included angle condition between the thruster and the star camera boresight, and then presents two methods to calculate the target attitude quaternion. Both of the two methods need first design the optimal trajectory of the thrust vector, and then use geometric and nonlinear programming methods to calculate the attitude trajectory. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a typical application of a dual-spacecraft formation initialization.},

Using dual quaternion, we establish the relative coupled dynamic model in which the coupling effect between translational and rotational motion is indicated. Based on the logarithm of dual quaternion, a model-independent PD-like controller is proposed for spacecraft tracking control problem. The convergence of the closed loop system in the presence of external disturbances is proven theoretically. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated by numerical simulations. The advantages of the proposed controller are displayed by comparing with others.},

  abstract      = {Abstract The design of interplanetary trajectories based on patched circular restricted three body models is gradually becoming a valuable alternative to the classical patched conic approach. The main advantage offered by such a model is the possibility to exploit the manifold dynamics to move naturally far from or toward a body. Generally, propulsive maneuvers are required to match these structures. Low-thrust arcs offer the possibility to have a significant propellant mass reduction when moving from manifold to manifold. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology to design low-thrust trajectories between two planetary orbits connecting the manifolds of two circular three body systems. The approach is based on a grid search on the main parameters governing the solution to identify those trajectories moving within the manifold images on given Poincar{\`e} sections. The value of the Jacoby constant of the target libration point periodic orbit is chosen as stop condition for the thrusting phases. Ballistic arcs follow up to the proper Poincar{\`e} section intersection. A grid search for an Earth to Venus transfer is presented as test case.},

  abstract      = {There are currently more than 19,000 trackable objects in Earth orbit, 1,300 of which are active. With so many objects populating the space object catalog and new objects being added at an ever increasing rate, ensuring continued access to space is quickly becoming a cornerstone of national security policies. Space Situational Awareness (SSA) supports space operations, space flight safety, implementing international treaties and agreements, protecting of space capabilities, and protecting of national interests. With respect to objects in orbit, this entails determining their location, orientation, size, shape, status, purpose, current tasking, and future tasking. For active spacecraft capable of propulsion, the problem of determining these characteristics becomes significantly more difficult. Optimal control techniques can be applied to object correlation, maneuver detection, maneuver/spacecraft characterization, fuel usage estimation, operator priority inference, intercept capability characterization, and fuel-constrained range set determination. A detailed mapping between optimal control applications and SSA object characterization support is reviewed and related literature visited. Each SSA application will be addressed starting from first-principles using optimal control techniques. For each application, several examples of potential utility are given and discussed.},

  abstract      = {The problem of free-time optimal reachability set computation with alternate integral constraints is motivated and examined. Specific examples of such systems are optimal spacecraft, aircraft and automobile free-time, fuel-limited range computation. An alternate Hamilton Jacobi Bellman PDE formulation is derived using a Generalized Independent Parameter (GIP) associated with the integration constraint and GIP mapping function with respect to time is defined. Necessary conditions on the GIP mapping function are identified and discussed. Singular independent parameter mapping functions, often found in astrodynamics optimal control problems, are shown to be challenging to solve using a simple change of integration variable, motivating an approach to transform such problems before solving. Several short illustrations are used to emphasize theoretical cases of interest, and two simple fully-worked examples are given to demonstrate the potential utility of this approach.},

  abstract      = {Questions of reachability for continuous and hybrid systems can be formulated as optimal control or game theory problems, whose solution can be characterized using variants of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman or Isaacs partial differential equations. The formal link between the solution to the partial differential equation and the reachability problem is usually established in the framework of viscosity solutions. This paper establishes such a link between reachability, viability and invariance problems and viscosity solutions of a special form of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. This equation is developed to address optimal control problems where the cost function is the minimum of a function of the state over a specified horizon. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that the properties of the value function (uniform continuity) and the form of the partial differential equation (standard Hamilton--Jacobi form, continuity of the Hamiltonian and simple boundary conditions) make the numerical solution of the problem much simpler than other approaches proposed in the literature. This fact is demonstrated by applying our approach to a reachability problem that arises in flight control and using numerical tools to compute the solution.},

Analytical expressions for general state partition extrema are developed, yielding necessary conditions for reachability as well as tools for significant reduction in reachability computation. Similar relations for position and velocity reachability set surface computation are also developed and the computation implications discussed. Several examples are worked to illustrate results, and finally directions for future work are discussed.},

  abstract      = {This work deals with the design of transfers connecting LEOs with halo orbits around libration points of the Earth--Moon CRTBP using impulsive maneuvers. Exploiting the coupled circular restricted three-body problem approximation, suitable first guess trajectories are derived detecting intersections between stable manifolds related to halo orbits of EM spatial CRTBP and Earth-escaping trajectories integrated in planar Sun--Earth CRTBP. The accuracy of the intersections in configuration space and the discontinuities in terms of {{$\Delta$}}v are controlled through the box covering structure implemented in the software GAIO. Finally first guess solutions are optimized in the bicircular four-body problem and single-impulse and two-impulse transfers are presented.},

  abstract      = {This paper is concerned with some reformulations of the classical computational scheme for solving optimal control problems via Pontryagin's maximum principle. The purpose is to alleviate some well known difficulties involved in solving a two-point boundary value problem in terms of adjoint variables. To this end there is discussion of the avoidance of explicit use of transversality conditions and the use of initial control rather than adjoint variables as the basis of the iterative procedure. The application of these ideas to some practical problems of spacecraft trajectory optimization is considered.},

  abstract      = {The development of electric propulsion systems such as ion engines has brought low-thrust control into practical use. This has made the design of spacecraft trajectories with low continuous thrust more and more demanding. This work concerns low-energy transfer trajectories between the Jupiter satellites using effectively the n-body dynamics in the Jupiter system and low-thrust controls. To analyze the dynamics of n-body models, we use the three-body problem as a model and apply the patched three-body approximation. We also use invariant manifold tubes and the result provides how to connect two different manifolds with low-thrust, low-energy trajectories.},

In this paper, using the invariant manifolds of nonlinear 3-body systems, we constructed low energy transfer trajectories to the Moon. Along the method used by JPL research group, we approximated the Sun-Earth-Moon-spacecraft four-body system as two plane circular restricted there-body systems, and then presented more profound explanation for Hiten s trajectory in mathematics and dynamics. Considering the direction of the rotation of Earth-Moon L2 stable manifolds, we presented their structures and a more reasonable patching method, and obtained the position and velocity of the spacecraft at the launch point, and finally designed a trajectory which requires 12{\%} less velocity increment than traditional method. The results prove the feasibility and advantage of invariant manifolds of 3-body systems in designing and constructing trajectories from the Earth to the Moon.},

The model of spacecraft rendezvous takes the perturbations in ini- tial states, the actuator saturation limits, the measure- ment errors, and the external disturbance forces into consideration from an engineering point of view. The proposed nonlinear closed-loop feedback control strat- egy is not analytically explicit; rather, it is imple- mented by a rapid re-computation of the open-loop optimal control at each update instant. To guarantee the computational efficiency, a novel numerical algo- rithm for solving the open-loop optimal control is given. With the aid of the quasilinearization method, the open-loop optimal control problem is replaced successfully by a series of sparse symmetrical linear equations coupled with linear complementary problem, and the computational efficiency can be significantly increased. The numerical simulations of spacecraft rendezvous problems in the paper well demonstrate the robustness, high precision, and dominant real-time merits of the proposed closed-loop feedback control strategy.},

This low dimensionality combined with the extraordinary speed of modern computers allows for rapid exploration of the parameter space and invites opportunities for global optimization. Accordingly, a general low-thrust trade analysis tool is developed based on a global search for local indirect method solutions. An efficient propagator is implemented with an implicit ``bang-bang'' thrusting structure that accommodates an a priori unknown number of switching times. An extension to the standard adjoint control transformation is introduced that provides additional physical insight and control over the anticipated evolution of the thrust profile. The uniformly random search enjoys a perfect linear speedup for parallel implementation. The method is applied specifically on multirevolution transfers in the Jupiter--Europa and Earth--moon restricted three body problems. In both cases, thousands of solutions are found in a single parallel run. The result is a global front of Pareto optimal solutions across the competing objectives of flight time and final mass.},

  abstract      = {Preliminary designs of low-thrust transfer trajectories are developed in the Earth--moon three-body problem with variable specific impulse engines and fixed engine power. The solution for a complete time history of the thrust magnitude and direction is initially approached as a calculus of variations problem to locally maximize the final spacecraft mass. The problem is then solved directly by sequential quadratic programming, using either single or multiple shooting. The coasting phase along the transfer exploits invariant manifolds and, when possible, considers locations along the entire manifold surface for insertion. Such an approach allows for a nearly propellant-free final coasting phase along an arc selected from a family of known trajectories that contract to the periodic libration point orbit. This investigation includes transfer trajectories from an Earth parking orbit to some sample libration point trajectories, including L1 halo orbits, L1 and L2 vertical orbits, and L2 butterfly orbits. Given the availability of variable specific impulse engines in the future, this study indicates that fuel-efficient transfer trajectories could be used in future lunar missions, such as south pole communications satellite architectures.},

A strategy to compute low-thrust transfer trajectories in the Earth-moon circular restricted three-body problem is developed. The dynamical model is formulated assuming variable specific impulse engines, an advanced finite-thrust propulsion model. Originating in an Earth parking orbit, the spacecraft is delivered to a location along the stable manifold; the engines power off and the spacecraft asymptotically approaches the periodic libration point orbit of interest. Elements of optimal control theory are used to derive a primer vector control law as well as a set of additional dependent variables that characterize the solution to the corresponding two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP). A hybrid direct/indirect method results in transfer trajectories that are associated with locally minimal propellant consumption. The generation of useful initial conditions is aided by an adjoint control transformation and a global ``shotgun'' method. The solution strategy is demonstrated in a detailed development of transfers to a 12-day L1 halo orbit, a 14-day L1 vertical orbit, and a 14-day L2 ``butterfly'' orbit. These target orbits are all selected from the families that meet line-of-sight coverage requirements in support of lunar south pole mission architecture.},

  abstract      = {Ozimek, Martin T. Ph.D., Purdue University, May 2010. Low-Thrust Trajectory Design and Optimization of Lunar South Pole Coverage Missions. Major Professor: Kathleen C. Howell.
A framework for designing and optimizing low-thrust trajectories for lunar south pole coverage missions is developed. Such missions may involve three, two, or even one satellite to maintain continuous communications between a lunar ground station and the Earth. Special emphasis is dedicated to single satellite communication links, which involve the design and discovery of novel pole-sitter orbits. Pole-sitters are pos- sible, given the availability of an efficient low-thrust force in the model. Low-thrust acceleration can be delivered in various forms; solar sails and electric propulsion en- gines are obvious examples. Low-thrust propulsion may also be employed to construct transfer trajectories to the coverage orbits of interest as well as end-of-life transfers. Additionally, a low-thrust thruster allows a spacecraft to shift between lunar cov- erage orbits. In this scenario, an optimal control-based approach is applicable for rapidly computing trajectories, however, in general, the many complexities involved in generating the trajectories are best solved with a direct transcription approach using collocation and mesh refinement. This general process is robust and allows for the inclusion of an unknown control history, path constraints, and the simulta- neous optimization of multiple phases while exploiting matrix sparsity for maximum computational efficiency. Even incorporating higher-fidelity dynamical effects, the pole-sitter solutions can be sustained as a long-duration option, using a solar sail, or as a temporary option in excess of one year on a small 500 kg spacecraft, using a solar electric propulsion engine comparable to existing technology.},

These related phenomena have been of concern for some time in topics such as the cap- ture of comets and asteroids and with the design of trajectories for space missions such as the Genesis Discovery Mission. The main new technical result in this paper is the numerical demonstration of the existence of a heteroclinic connection between pairs of periodic orbits, one around the libration point L1 and the other around L2, with the two periodic orbits having the same energy. This result is applied to the resonance transition problem and to the explicit numerical construction of interesting orbits with prescribed itineraries. The point of view developed in this paper is that the invariant manifold structures associated to L1 and L2 as well as the aforementioned heteroclinic connection are fundamental tools that can aid in understanding dynamical channels throughout the solar system as well as transport between the ``interior'' and ``exterior'' Hill's regions and other resonant phenomena.},

  abstract      = {With an environment comparable to that of primordial Earth, a surface strewn with liquid hydrocarbon lakes, and an atmosphere denser than that of any other moon in the solar system, Saturn's largest moon Titan is a treasure trove of potential scien- tific discovery and is the target of a proposed NASA mission scheduled for launch in roughly one decade. A chief consideration associated with the design of any such mission is the constraint imposed by fuel limitations that accompany the spacecraft's journey between celestial bodies. In this study, we explore the use of patched three- body models in conjunction with a discrete mechanical optimization algorithm for the design of a fuel-efficient Saturnian moon tour focusing on Titan. In contrast to the use of traditional models for trajectory design such as the patched conic approx- imation, we exploit subtleties of the three-body problem, a classic problem from celestial mechanics that asks for the motion of three masses in space under mutual gravitational interaction, in order to slash fuel costs. In the process, we demonstrate the aptitude of the DMOC (Discrete Mechanics and Optimal Control) optimization algorithm in handling celestial mechanical trajectory optimization problems.},

Mission design requires the efficient management of spacecraft fuel to reduce mis- sion cost, increase payload mass, and extend mission life. High efficiency, low-thrust propulsion devices potentially offer significant propellant reductions. Periodic orbits that exist in a multi-body regime and low-thrust transfers between these orbits can be applied in many potential mission scenarios, including scientific observation and communications missions as well as cargo transport. In light of the recent discov- ery of water ice in lunar craters, libration point orbits that support human missions within the Earth-Moon region are of particular interest. This investigation considers orbit transfer trajectories generated by a variable specific impulse, low-thrust engine with a primer-vector-based, fuel-optimizing transfer strategy. A multiple shooting procedure with analytical gradients yields rapid solutions and serves as the basis for an investigation into the trade space between flight time and consumption of fuel mass. Path and performance constraints can be included at node points along any thrust arc. Integration of invariant manifolds into the design strategy may also yield improved performance and greater fuel savings. The resultant transfers offer insight into the performance of the variable specific impulse engine and suggest novel im- plementations of conventional impulsive thrusters. Transfers incorporating invariant manifolds demonstrate the fuel savings and expand the mission design capabilities that are gained by exploiting system symmetry. A number of design applications are generated.},

To expand mission capabilities that are required for exploration of the solar system, methodologies to design optimal low-thrust trajectories must be developed. However, low-thrust, multiple gravity-assist trajectories pose significant optimization challenges because of their expansive, multimodal design space. In this work, a technique is developed for global, low-thrust, interplanetary trajectory optimization through the hybridization of a genetic algorithm and a gradient-based direct method (GALLOP). The hybrid algorithm combines the effective global search capabilities of a genetic algorithm with the robust convergence and constraint handling of the local, calculus-based direct method. The automated approach alleviates the difficulty and biases of initial guess generation and provides near globally-optimal solutions. Both single objective and multiobjective implementations are developed. In the single objective implementation, the technique is applied to several complex low-thrust, gravity-assist trajectory scenarios, generating previously unpublished optimums. Specifically, the single objective hybrid algorithm generates apparent global optimums for a direct trajectory scenario to Mars, as well as gravity-assist trajectories with three intermediate flybys to Neptune and Pluto. The multiobjective implementation incorporates the NSGA-II algorithm to generate a Pareto front of solutions that are globally optimal in terms of both final delivered mass and time-of-flight in a single execution. The multiobjective hybrid algorithm is applied to a direct Earth-Mars rendezvous design scenario, successfully developing a Pareto front of near-globally optimal trajectories, enabling a tradeoff decision on the two objectives.},

The dif- ference among the three maneuvers mainly lie in the terminal constraint conditions. By the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, the trajectory optimization problem is converted into the two- point boundary-value problem, and the terminal constraint conditions of the three orbital maneuver missions are also investigated respectively. The single shooting method is used to solve the corresponding boundary-value problem, and the simulations show that the product of the minimum flight time and the maximal thrust is near constant in the three maneuver problems.},

  abstract      = {A gyrostat [1] is a mechanical system S which consists of a solid body \{S1\} and other bodies \{S2\} which are connected to it. These other bodies are either variable or solid, but their motion relative to the body \{S1\} does not alter the geometry of the mass system S. Examples of such systems are: a solid body to which there are connected axes of several (or of one) symmetric gyroscopes: or a solid body with a cavity of arbitrary shape entirely filled with a homogeneous liquid; and similar systems. It is obvious that for a given distribution of masses in a gyrostat no change can occur in the position of the center of gravity of the principal axes and of the moments of inertia of the gyrostat with respect to any point of the solid body \{S1\} as the result of the internal motion of the bodies S2. In the present work there is investigated, by the use of the second method of Liapunov, the stability of certain motions of heavy gyrostats with one fixed point.},

  abstract      = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers & results.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents a novel method for the orbit control of high area-to-mass ratio spacecraft, such as spacecraft-on-a-chip, future smart dust devices and inflatable spacecraft. By changing the reflectivity coefficient of an electrochromic coating of the spacecraft, the perturbing effect of solar radiation pressure (SRP) is exploited to enable long-lived orbits and to control formations, without the need for propellant consumption or active pointing. The spacecraft is coated with a thin film of an electrochromic material that changes its reflectivity coefficient when a small current is applied. The change of reflectance alters the fraction of the radiation pressure force that is transmitted to the satellite, and hence has a direct effect on the spacecraft orbit evolution. The orbital element space is analysed to identify orbits which can be stabilised with electrochromic orbit control. A closed-loop feedback control method using an artificial potential field approach is introduced to stabilise these otherwise unsteady orbits. The stability of this solution is analysed and verified through numerical simulation. Finally, a test case is simulated in which the control method is used to perform orbital manoeuvres for a spacecraft formation.},

  abstract   = {We observed the near-Earth \{ASTEROID\} 2008 \{EV5\} with the Arecibo and Goldstone planetary radars and the Very Long Baseline Array during December 2008. \{EV5\} rotates retrograde and its overall shape is a 400 $\pm$ 50 m oblate spheroid. The most prominent surface feature is a ridge parallel to the asteroid{\textquoteright}s equator that is broken by a concavity about 150 m in diameter. Otherwise the asteroid{\textquoteright}s surface is notably smooth on decameter scales. EV5{\textquoteright}s radar and optical albedos are consistent with either rocky or stony-iron composition. The equatorial ridge is similar to structure seen on the rubble-pile near-Earth asteroid (66391) 1999 \{KW4\} and is consistent with \{YORP\} spin-up reconfiguring the asteroid in the past. We interpret the concavity as an impact crater. Shaking during the impact and later regolith redistribution may have erased smaller features, explaining the general lack of decameter-scale surface structure.},

Using data from a nationally representative survey of American adults, we employ regression analysis to better understand the relationships between several variables---including values, knowledge, and media attention---and trust in religious organizations and scientific institutions. We found that Evangelical Christians are generally more trusting of religious authority figures to tell the truth about the risks and benefits of science and technology, and only slightly less likely than non-Evangelicals to trust scientific authorities for the same information. We also found that many Evangelicals use mediated information and science knowledge differently than non-Evangelicals, with both increased knowledge and attention to scientific media having positive impacts on trust in scientific authorities among the latter, but not the former group.},

This paper presents a detailed analysis of six functions for measuring distance between 3D rotations that have been proposed in the literature. Based on the well-developed theory behind 3D rotations, we demonstrate that five of them are bi-invariant metrics on SO(3) but that only four of them are boundedly equivalent to each other. We conclude that it is both spatially and computationally more efficient to use quaternions for 3D rotations. Lastly, by treating the two rotations as a true and an estimated rotation matrix, we illustrate the geometry associated with iso-error measures.},

  abstract  = {The daily motion of the Moon through the sky has many unusual features that a careful observer can
discover without the help of instruments. The three different frequencies for the three degrees of
freedom have been known very accurately for 3000 years, and the geometric explanation of the Greek
astronomers was basically correct. Whereas Kepler{\textquoteright}s laws are sufficient for describing the motion of
the planets around the Sun, even the most obvious facts about the lunar motion cannot be understood
without the gravitational attraction of both the Earth and the Sun. Newton discussed this problem at
great length, and with mixed success; it was the only testing ground for his Universal Gravitation. This
background for today{\textquoteright}s many-body theory is discussed in some detail because all the guiding principles
for our understanding can be traced to the earliest developments of astronomy. They are the oldest
results of scientific inquiry, and they were the first ones to be confirmed by the great
physicist-mathematicians of the 18\textsuperscript{th} century. By a variety of methods, Laplace was able to claim
complete agreement of celestial mechanics with the astronomical observations. Lagrange initiated a
new trend wherein the mathematical problems of mechanics could all be solved by the same uniform
process; canonical transformations eventually won the field. They were used for the first time on a
large scale by Delaunay to find the ultimate solution of the lunar problem by perturbing the solution
of the two-body Earth-Moon problem. Hill then treated the lunar trajectory as a displacement from
a periodic orbit that is an exact solution of a restricted three-body problem. Newton{\textquoteright}s difficultly in
explaining the motion of the lunar perigee was finally resolved, and the Moon{\textquoteright}s orbit was computed
by a new method that became the universal standard until after WW II. Poincar{\'{e}} opened the 20\textsuperscript{th}
century with his analysis of trajectories in phase space, his insistence on investigating periodic orbits
even in ergodic systems, and his critique of perturbation theory, particularly in the case of the Moon{\textquoteright}s
motion. Space exploration, astrophysics, and the landing of the astronauts on the Moon led to a new
flowering of celestial mechanics. Lunar theory now has to confront many new data beyond the simple
three-body problem in order to improve its accuracy below the precision of 1 arcsecond; the computer
dominates all the theoretical advances. This review is intended as a case study of the many stages that
characterize the slow development of a problem in physics from simple observations through many
forms of explanation to a high-precision fit with the data. [S0034-6861(98)00802-2]},

First, a smooth feedback control system is constructed to follow a desired trajectory on the two-sphere, while guaranteeing almost global exponential stability. Next, a hybrid control scheme is proposed to achieve global exponential stability by introducing an additional expelling mode. It is shown that there is one dimensional degree of freedom in the expelling mode, and it is optimized to minimize selected measures of the overall tracking performance. The proposed optimal construction of hybrid controls, while guaranteeing global attractivity on the two-sphere is the unique contribution of this paper. These are illustrated by numerical examples.},

  abstract  = {This study introduces a procedure to obtain general expressions, y = f (x), subject to linear constraints on the function and its derivatives defined at specified values. These constrained expressions can be used describe functions with embedded spe- cific constraints. The paper first shows how to express the most general explicit function passing through a single point in three distinct ways: linear, additive, and rational. Then, functions with constraints on single, two, or multiple points are introduced as well as those satisfying relative constraints. This capability allows to obtain general expressions to solve linear differential equations with no need to satisfy constraints (the {\textquotedblleft}subject to:{\textquotedblright} conditions) as the constraints are already embedded in the constrained expression. In particular, for expressions passing through a set of points, a generalization of the Waring{\textquoteright}s interpolation form, is in- troduced. The general form of additive constrained expressions is introduced as well as a procedure to derive its coefficient functions, requiring the inversion of a matrix with dimensions as the number of constraints.},

  abstract  = {Human behavior is never an exact science, making the design and programming of artificial intelligence that seeks to replicate human behavior difficult. Usually, the answers cannot be found in sterile algorithms that are often the focus of artificial intelligence programming. However, by analyzing why people behave the way we do, we can break down the process into increasingly smaller components. We can model many of those individual components in the language of logic and mathematics and then reassemble them into larger, more involved decision-making processes. Drawing from classical game theory, "Behavioral Mathematics for Game AI" covers both the psychological foundations of human decisions and the mathematical modeling techniques that AI designers and programmers can use to replicate them. With examples from both real life and game situations, you'll explore topics such as utility, the fallacy of rational behavior, and the inconsistencies and contradictions that human behavior often exhibits. You'll examine various ways of using statistics, formulas, and algorithms to create believable simulations and to model these dynamic, realistic, and interesting behaviors in video games. Finally, you'll be introduced to a number of tools you can use in conjunction with standard AI algorithms to make it easier to utilize the mathematical models.},

Uncertainties in the angular velocity and attitude are described in terms of ellipsoidal sets that are propagated through this nonlinear attitude flow. Computational methods are proposed, one method based on a local linearization of the attitude flow and two methods based on propagation of a small (unscented) sample selected from the initial uncertainty ellipsoid. Each of these computational methods is constructed using a Lie group variational integrator, viewed as a discretization of the attitude dynamics. Computational results are obtained that indicate: (1) the strongly nonlinear attitude flow characteristics; and (2) the limitations of each of these methods, and indeed any method, in providing effective global bounds on the nonlinear attitude flow.},

We describe a pseudo likelihood procedure which works for the Bingham distribution in any dimension. This alternative approach does not require numerical integration. Results on the asymptotic efficiency of the pseudo likelihood estimator relative to the maximum likelihood estimator are given, and the two estimators are compared in the analysis of a well-known vectorcardiography dataset.}},

Several properties of the matrix Fisher distribution on the special orthogonal group are presented, and an unscented transform is proposed to approximate a matrix Fisher distribution by selected sigma points. Based on these, an intrinsic, global framework for Bayesian attitude estimation is developed. It is shown that the proposed approach can successfully deal with large initial estimator errors and large uncertainties over complex maneuvers to obtain accurate estimates of the attitude.}},

We introduce quasistatic cavity resonance (QSCR), which can enable purpose-built structures, such as cabinets, rooms, and warehouses, to generate quasistatic magnetic fields that safely deliver kilowatts of power to mobile receivers contained nearly anywhere within. A theoretical model of a quasistatic cavity resonator is derived, and field distributions along with power transfer efficiency are validated against measured results. An experimental demonstration shows that a 54 m3 QSCR room can deliver power to small coil receivers in nearly any position with 40% to 95% efficiency. Finally, a detailed safety analysis shows that up to 1900 watts can be transmitted to a coil receiver enabling safe and ubiquitous wireless power.},

  abstract  = {The configuration space for rigid spacecraft systems in a central gravitational field can be modeled by SO(3)$\times$ IR3, where the special orthogonal group SO(3) represents the attitude dynamics and IR3 is for the orbital motion. The attitude dynamics of the spacecraft system is affected by the orbital elements through the well-known gravity-gradient torque. On the other hand, the effects of attitude-orbit coupling can also possibly be used to alter orbital motions by controlling the attitude. This controllability property is the primary issue of this paper. The control systems for spacecraft with either reaction wheels or gas jets being used as attitude controllers are proven in this study to be controllable. Rigorously establishing these results necessitates starting with the formal definitions of controllability and Poisson stability. It is then shown that if the drift vector field of the system is weakly positively Poisson stable and the Lie algebra rank condition is satisfied, controllability can be concluded. The Hamiltonian structure of the spacecraft model provides a natural route of verifying the property of weakly positive Poisson stability. Accordingly, the controllability is obtained after confirming the Lie algebra rank condition. Developing a methodology in deriving Lie brackets in the tangent space of T(SO(3)$\times$IR3), i.e., the second tangent bundle is thus deemed necessary. A general formula is offered for the computation of Lie brackets of second tangent vector fields in TT(SO(3)m$\times$IRn), in light of its importance in the fields of mechanics, robotics, optimal control, and nonlinear control, among others. With these tools, the controllability results can be proved. The analysis in this paper gives some insight into the attitude-orbit coupling effects and may potentially lead towards new techniques in designing controllers for large spacecraft systems},

Four mathematical formalisms for effecting a general spatial screw displacement are discussed and analyzed in terms of computational efficiency in performing common operations needed in kinematic analysis of multilinked spatial mechanisms. The corresponding algorithms are analyzed in terms of both sequential and parallel execution. It is concluded that the dual-unit quaternion representation offers the most compact and most efficient screw transformation formalism but that line-oriented methods in general are not well suited for efficient kinematic computations or real-time control applications. Owing to line-based geometry, underlying its definition, screw calculus represents a set of valuable tools in theoretical kinematics. However, the mathematical redundancy inherent in Plucker coordinate space representation makes the screw calculus computationally less attractive than the corresponding point-oriented formalisms},

  abstract  = {Saturn{\textquoteright}s moon Enceladus has a subsurface ocean covered by a layer of ice. Some liquid escapes into space through cracks in the ice, which is the source of one of Saturn{\textquoteright}s rings. In October 2015, the Cassini spacecraft flew directly through the plume of escaping material and sampled its chemical composition. Waite et al. found that the plume contains molecular hydrogen, H2, a sign that the water in Enceladus{\textquoteright} ocean is reacting with rocks through hydrothermal processes (see the Perspective by Seewald). This drives the ocean out of chemical equilibrium, in a similar way to water around Earth{\textquoteright}s hydrothermal vents, potentially providing a source of chemical energy.Science, this issue p. 155; see also p. 132Saturn{\textquoteright}s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument{\textquoteright}s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO2 in Enceladus{\textquoteright} ocean.},

        * Must have balistic coefficient  50 kg/m^3 to deliver payload to subsonic conditions
        * Hypersonic deceleration happens at lower altitude so there is not much time remaining for landing
        * All US landing missions still use a Viking era 70 deg sphere cone for high hypersonic drag coefficient

        * Mars has a bi-modal surface altitude distribution. 
        * Half of Mars has currently been out of reach due to high elevation
        * Lots of large rocks and difficult to see from orbit make legged landers susceptible
        * Landing site slope greater than 3m is difficult to measure from orbit
    3. Difficult to accurately recreate Mars environment for EDL testing and qualification
        * Short time for EDL and switching between computer systems mean there is frequently no redundancy
        * Not able to test on Earth easily so will use older systems which have flown

* Sensors are expensive: Radar is cheaper than Doppler for measuring horizontal velocity
* All US Mars landers still use the Viking developed aeroshell, thermal protective material, supersonic parachute},

  abstract  = {An autonomous rendezvous guidance scheme for spacecraft to descend to small celestial bodies by using optical information is presented. First, a new guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) method based on fixation-point (FP) inheritance is proposed. A spacecraft can safely descend toward the target point on the celestial body by tracking and autonomously renewing the FPs on the surface. Next, we deal with the method of extracting the FPs. A spatial band-pass filter (BPF) is applied to pictures taken to enhance features having comparable size with the tracking window. Local variance of the filtered image is used as a criterion of the extraction. Then, the relative information between the spacecraft and the celestial body (position, velocity, attitude, etc.) is calculated from the image coordinates and the range measurements of the FPs from the spacecraft. To suppress observation noise and improve navigation accuracy, an application of the extended Kalman filter is also presented. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the guidance precision and the fuel consumption of the proposed guidance scheme},

Thus, a robust spacecraft-based position estimation system is a critical near term need. We present in this paper a vision-based system, which provides a low power, low cost, high accuracy solution with flight proven hardware. The key components of our image based localization approach are: (1) real-time detection of landmarks in descent imagery, (2) real-time matching of detected landmarks to a stored database, and (3) robust estimation of spacecraft state (position, attitude and velocity) from matched 2D-3D data. We present an analysis of the performance and noise sensitivity of our system and show that the suggested technology is able to deliver a spacecraft to within 100 meters of a pre-selected landing site in a typical Mars landing scenario.},

The vision front-end of the VISINAV system extracts 2-D-to-3-D correspondences between descent images and a surface map (mapped landmarks), as well as 2-D-to-2-D feature tracks through a sequence of descent images (opportunistic features). An extended Kalman filter (EKF) tightly integrates both types of visual feature observations with measurements from an inertial measurement unit. The filter computes accurate estimates of the lander's terrain-relative position, attitude, and velocity, in a resource-adaptive and hence real-time capable fashion. In addition to the technical analysis of the algorithm, the paper presents validation results from a sounding-rocket test flight, showing estimation errors of only 0.16 m/s for velocity and 6.4 m for position at touchdown. These results vastly improve current state of the art for terminal descent navigation without visual updates, and meet the requirements of future planetary exploration missions.},

The inference engine combines an estimate of the landing footprint with information about the safeness of the landing terrain to construct an overall landing site quality index. The landing site quality index is a critical parameter that enables the spacecraft to make intelligent real-time decisions about landing safely on unknown and hazardous terrains. The footprint generated from the ballistic analysis is also compared with the footprint resulting from numerically integrating a representative guidance law.},

The MSL EDL sequence is a result of a more stringent requirement set than any of its predecessors. Notable among these requirements is landing a 900 kg rover in a landing ellipse much smaller than that of any previous Mars lander. In meeting these requirements, MSL is extending the limits of the EDL technologies qualified by the Mars viking, Mars pathfinder, and Mars exploration rover missions. Thus, there are many design challenges that must be solved for the mission to be successful. Several pieces of the EDL design are technological firsts, such as guided entry and precision landing on another planet, as well as the entire sky crane maneuver. This paper discusses the MSL EDL architecture and discusses some of the challenges faced in delivering an unprecedented rover payload to the surface of Mars.},

By providing an EDL system capable of landing at altitudes as high as 2 km above the reference areoid, as defined by the Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter (MOLA) program, MSL will demonstrate sufficient performance to land on a large fraction of the Martian surface. By contrast, the highest altitude landing to date on Mars has been the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) MER-B at 1.44 km below the areoid. The coupling of this improved altitude performance with latitude limits as large as 60 degrees off of the equator and a precise delivery to within 10 km of a surface target will allow the science community to select the MSL landing site from thousands of scientifically interesting possibilities. In meeting these requirements, MSL is extending the limits of the EDL technologies qualified by the Mars Viking, Mars Pathfinder, and MER missions. This paper discusses the MSL EDL architecture, system, and subsystem design and discusses some of the challenges faced in delivering such an unprecedented rover payload to the surface of Mars},

To enable this capability, a fully autonomous onboard system that identifies and avoids hazardous features such as steep slopes and large rocks is required. Such a system will also provide greater functionality in unstructured terrain to unmanned aerial vehicles. This paper describes an algorithm for landing hazard avoidance based on images from a single moving camera. The core of the algorithm is an efficient application of structure from motion to generate a dense elevation map of the landing area. Hazards are then detected in this map and a safe landing site is selected. The algorithm has been implemented on an autonomous helicopter testbed and demonstrated four times resulting in the first autonomous landing of an unmanned helicopter in unknown and hazardous terrain.},

Second, the directional vector from spacecraft to the center of each feature point can be computed from the image coordinates in camera focal plane. Then, LIDAR/LRF is directed to three feature points and the distances from spacecraft to feature points are obtained. Last, the relative position vector from spacecraft to the target asteroid is reconstructed base on measurement outputs of navigation cameras and laser light radar (laser range finder).Findings -- Suppose the initial conditions presented in this paper, the autonomous optical navigation position error and velocity error are less than 1\hspace{0.167em}m and 0.1\hspace{0.167em}m/s, respectively; this navigation accuracy can satisfy the requirement of soft landing on asteroids.Originality/value -- Based on feature detection and tracking, an autonomous optical navigation scheme is brought out and the validity is confirmed by computer simulation.},

  abstract   = {The driving precision landing requirement for the Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology project is to autonomously land within 100 m of a predetermined location on the lunar surface. Traditional lunar landing approaches based on inertial sensing do not have the navigational precision to meet this requirement. The purpose of Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) is to augment inertial navigation by providing position or bearing measurements relative to known surface landmarks. From these measurements, the navigational precision can be reduced to a level that meets the 100 m requirement. There are three different TRN functions: global position estimation, local position estimation and velocity estimation. These functions can be achieved with active range sensing or passive imaging. This paper gives a survey of many TRN approaches and then presents some high fidelity simulation results for contour matching and area correlation approaches to TRN using active sensors. Since TRN requires an a-priori reference map, the paper concludes by describing past and future lunar imaging and digital elevation map data sets available for this purpose.},

  2. Active range sensors - laser or other rangefinders

* Algorithms are broken into pattern matching vs. correlation based

  abstract  = {We address the problem of obtaining dense surface information from a sparse set of 3D data in the presence of spurious noise samples. The input can be in the form of points, or points with an associated tangent or normal, allowing both position and direction to be corrupted by noise. Most approaches treat the problem as an interpolation problem, which is solved by fitting a surface such as a membrane or thin plate to minimize some function. We argue that these physical constraints are not sufficient, and propose to impose additional perceptual constraints such as good continuity and {\textquotedblleft}cosurfacity{\textquotedblright}. These constraints allow us to not only infer surfaces, but also to detect surface orientation discontinuities, as well as junctions, all at the same time. The approach imposes no restriction on genus, number of discontinuities, number of objects, and is noniterative. The result is in the form of three dense saliency maps for surfaces, intersections between surfaces (i.e., 3D curves), and 3D junctions, respectively. These saliency maps are then used to guide a {\textquotedblleft}marching{\textquotedblright} process to generate a description (e.g., a triangulated mesh) making information about surfaces, space curves, and 3D junctions explicit. The traditional marching process needs to be refined as the polarity of the surface orientation is not necessarily locally consistent. These three maps are currently not integrated, and this is the topic of our ongoing research. We present results on a variety of computer-generated and real data, having varying curvature, of different genus, and multiple objects},

  abstract   = {We present a system that estimates the motion of a stereo head or a single moving camera based on video input. The system operates in real-time with low delay and the motion estimates are used for navigational purposes. The front end of the system is a feature tracker. Point features are matched between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at video rate. Robust estimates of the camera motion are then produced from the feature tracks using a geometric hypothesize-and-test architecture. This generates what we call visual odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input alone. No prior knowledge of the scene nor the motion is necessary. The visual odometry can also be used in conjunction with information from other sources such as GPS, inertia sensors, wheel encoders, etc. The pose estimation method has been applied successfully to video from aerial, automotive and handheld platforms. We focus on results with an autonomous ground vehicle. We give examples of camera trajectories estimated purely from images over previously unseen distances and periods of time.},

Optimal estimates of the structure and motion can be computed by minimizing this expression just over the motion parameters. Also, we present a solution to the triangulation problem: an exact, explicit expression for the optimal structure estimate given the motion. We identify a new ambiguity in recovering the structure for known motion. We study the exact error's properties experimentally and demonstrate that it often has several local minima for forward or backward motion estimates. Our experiments also show that the "reflected" local minimum of Oliensis (2001) and Soatto et al. (1998) occurs for large translational motions. Our exact results assume that the camera is calibrated and use a least-squares image-reprojection error that applies most naturally to a spherical imaging surface. We approximately extend our approach to the standard least-squares error in the image plane and uncalibrated cameras. We present an improved version of the Sampson error which gives better results experimentally.},

Towards this end, we have developed an approach for improved state estimation by augmenting traditional inertial navigation techniques with image-based motion estimation (IBME). A Kalman filter that processes rotational velocity and linear acceleration measurements provided from an inertial measurement unit has been enhanced to accommodate relative pose measurements from the IBME. In addition to increased state estimation accuracy, IBME convergence time is reduced while robustness of the overall approach is improved. The methodology is described in detail and experimental results with a 5 DOF gantry testbed are presented.},

It is shown that even a small pixel-level perturbation may override the epipolar information that is essential for the linear algorithms to distinguish different motions. This analysis indicates the need for optimal estimation in the presence of noise. Methods are introduced for optimal motion and structure estimation under two situations of noise distribution: known and unknown. Computationally, the optimal estimation amounts to minimizing a nonlinear function. For the correct convergence of this nonlinear minimization, a two-step approach is used. The first step is using a linear algorithm to give a preliminary estimate for the parameters. The second step is minimizing the optimal objective function starting from that preliminary estimate as an initial guess. A remarkable accuracy improvement has been achieved by this two-step approach over using the linear algorithm alone},

The simulated experiments have been conducted using Eros Asteroid images. The results show that the algorithm can achieve high matching accuracy and is qualified for engineering application.},

The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM and consider future directions. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need SLAM? and Is SLAM solved?},

  * Map is frequently used for other tasks - path planning/visualization
  * Without Map dead reckoning would quickly diverge over time - by revisiting a known landmark (loop closure) the error is reset
  * SLAM might not be required if exact position is known already (GPS)
* Classical age of SLAM (1986-2004) which is in durrant-whyte2006 is characterized by EKF, Rao-blackwellized particle filters and maximum  likelihood estimation
* Algorithmic analysis age (2004-2015) - fundamental study of the properties of SLAM, observability, convergence, consistencey. Main libraries produced
* Main SLAM systems are composed of a front and back end
  * Front end abstracts measurements into models for estimation
    * Difficult to directly write sensor measurements as a analytical functino of the state which is required in MAP estimation
    * Data association is also critical to the front end  - short and long term association to handling the connection between measurements and landmarks as well as long term loop closure
  * Back end performs inferences on the data from the front end
    * Standard method is Maximum a posterior estimation - maximize belief of state/map given all the measurements using bayes rule
    * Generally proven to be more accurate and efficient than nonlinear filtering approaches

While there are still many practical issues to overcome, especially in more complex outdoor environments, the general SLAM method is now a well understood and established part of robotics. Another part of the tutorial summarized more recent works in addressing some of the remaining issues in SLAM, including computation, feature representation, and data association},
  comment    = {* Build a consistent map of an unknown enviornment while determining own location within the map
* At a theoretical and conceptual level, SLAM can now be considered a solved problem
* Key early contribution was the recognition that there is a high degree of correlation between estimates of the location of different landmarks in the map, and that the correlation between landmarks would grow with more observations.
* Another early contribution was the fact that a consitent full solution would require a joint state composed of the vehicle pose and every landmark position to be updated with each observation. This would require a large state vector that required computations which scale as the square of the number of landmarks
* Conceptual breakthrough was the formulating the problem as a combined mapping and localization estimation problem would lead to a convergent solution. More measurements will lead to a converged map and localization estimate
* The ideal goal is to make a recursive solution for the SLAM problem.
* Using a Bayseian probabilistic framework allows for a two-step predictor/corrector setup to estimate robot pose and map landmarks conditioned on inputs, measurements, and preivous states
* Error between estimated and true landmark locations is common between landmarks and is in fact due to a single source; errors in the knowledge of the robot
* Relative locations between two landmarks are known with high accuracy
* Correlation between landmark estimates increases monotonically with more observations and that knowledge of relative landmark location always improves and never diverges regardless of robot motion
* The measurements can be considered as nearly independent measurements of the relative location between landmarks
* Most common approach to solve probablistic SLAM - State space approach with additive gaussian noise using EKF-SLAM or represent more general particle filter approach for general distributions using the FastSLAM
* There is a large computational effort as each update step requires that all landmarks and the joint covariance matrix must be updated each time a measurement is made
* Another important consideration is that correct data association will cause SLAM to completely fail
* Measurment/Landmark association becomes even more difficult when landmarks look different from different views
* The key improvement with FastSLAM is the map is represented as a set of independent Gaussians with linear complexity rather than a joint map covariance with quadratic complexity
* Since we're dealing with particle filters we must resample to remove low weighted particles. However SIS sampling is only good for systems that exponentially forget their past, future states should become increasingly independent of previous states},

* In the state-based SLAM formulation the process model only updates the robot state, and the observation state only updates the landmarks
* There are some methods to reduce complexity in the EKF-SLAM approach:
  * Re-formulate the time-update using state-augmentation - assume the motion/dynamics only operate on robot state adn not the map
    * Seperate state adn map in EKF allows for new landmarks to be reduced to linear calculations
  * Observeration update can be partioned - only update a local map which is infreqently updated to the global map
    * sensor rate updates are confined to a smaller local region
    * Global pose is possible through vector addition of local maps
    * Global map is updated at a much lower freqency
  * Using information matrix form - creates sparse matrices which is faster
    * Many off-diagonal elements of the information matrix are zero
    * Efficient update procedures are possible using the sparse matrices
  * Sub-mapping allows for updates in a local map instead of the global map
    * Nearby landmarks are defined in a local coordinate frame
* Data association using batch gating. Also can use a multiple hypothesis approach to propogate multiple associations at once
  * Batch gating is usually sufficient to achieve reliable association},

  abstract   = {Abstract--- Recent advances in the characterization of small body surfaces with stereophotoclinometry are discussed. The principal data output is an ensemble of landmark maps (L-maps), high-resolution topography/albedo maps of varying resolution that tile the surface of the body. Because they can have a resolution comparable to the best images, and can be located on a global reference frame to high accuracy, L-maps provide a significant improvement in discriminatory power for studies of small bodies, ranging from regolith processes to interior structure. These techniques are now being used to map larger bodies such as the Moon and Mercury.L-maps are combined to produce a standard global topography model (GTM) with about 1.57 million vectors and having a wide variety of applications. They can also be combined to produce high-resolution topography maps that describe local areas with much greater detail than the GTM. When combined with nominal predictions from other data sources and available data from other instruments such as LIDAR or RADAR, solutions for the spacecraft position and camera pointing are the most accurate available. Examples are drawn from studies of Phobos, Eros, and Itokawa, including surface characterization, gravity analysis, spacecraft navigation, and incorporation of LIDAR or RADAR data. This work has important implications for potential future missions such as Deep Interior and the level of navigation and science that can be achieved.},
  comment    = {* Method to generate topography maps from imagery 
* These local topography maps are used as landmarks in the map building process 
* The local level maps are better across a wide range of viewing angles/conditions as compared to feature points in an image
* The method is from stereophotoclinometry - estimate surface slope and albedo at each pixel from many images
* This is then used to determine a shape model
* Now the spacecraft is free to fly any trajectory rather than keeping illumination constant usign a sun-synchronous orbit
* Using some iterative methods the slope and relative motion can be computed and an external source can be used to resolve the overall bias in the data
* All of these local topographic maps are then used to generate a shape model 
* This is a really cool idea and it might be neat to have a seqential method to do this, or some way to output the uncertainty associated with the model/localization},

In this work, we present an automatic estimation method for the shape and motion of an asteroid, which is planned to be tested in future exploration missions including Japanese Hayabusa-2 [1]. Our task is to estimate the shape and rotation axis of the asteroid, as well as positions of the spacecraft from optical images. The proposed method is based on the expectation conditional-maximization (ECM) framework that consists of an auxiliary particle filter and nonlinear optimization techniques. One of our technical contributions is the estimation of the direction of rotation axis of the asteroid from monocular camera images, which are taken by the moving spacecraft. We conducted two experiments with synthetic data and an asteroid mock-up to show the validity of the proposed method and to present the numerical accuracy.},

In mobile robotics many approaches for camera based autonomous navigation have been developed so far. We present an approach for vision based autonomous relative spacecraft rendezvous navigation between a chaser and an uncooperative and unknown target based on simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms (SLAM) concepts. The paper outlines the general concept and details the mathematical formulation for stereo image observables. Performance results are shown based on simulation experiments.},

  abstract  = {This paper demonstrates infrastructure-free orbital Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Individual surface landmarks are tracked through images taken in orbit and the filter receives measurements of these landmarks in the form of bearing angles. The filter then updates the spacecraft's position and velocity as well as landmark locations, thus building a map of the orbited body. In contrast to other approaches that use an IMU, which doesn't work in orbit, to resolve scale, the contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that scale can be resolved using orbital dynamics. Radio localization can be replaced with onboard localization, enabling truly autonomous missions to both under-mapped and unmapped planetary bodies. Overall system convergence is shown by simulating landmark detection from an orbit of the Clementine Mission on a Moon model constructed using Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) digital elevation data in conjunction with the filter. The techniques developed in this work demonstrate that when combined with a gravity model, visual SLAM converges to a full scale solution.},

  * Particle filter - able to handle non Gaussian distributions. Only been applied to the localization and not really the mapping portion yet
    * FASTSLAM is a good version which seperates localization and landmark estimation into seperate problems. This particle approach allows for many possible data associations in comparision to KF SLAM which is stuck with only a single data association
  * Expectation maximization method - two step process for getting an ideal map rather than the localization
    * Able to handle the data association problem very well. 
    * Iteratively  localizes the robot relative to a map by generating various hypotheses of robot location which are then used in a second step of translation to map features
* Key problem is associating measurements with specific landmarks in teh map. Getting this wrong can break SLAM
  * Better to use more features, 3D features rather than only 2D information
* Paper has a simple table listing the pros vs cons of the various SLAM approaches},

The system is robust to severe motion clutter, allows wide baseline loop closing and relocalization, and includes full automatic initialization. Building on excellent algorithms of recent years, we designed from scratch a novel system that uses the same features for all SLAM tasks: tracking, mapping, relocalization, and loop closing. A survival of the fittest strategy that selects the points and keyframes of the reconstruction leads to excellent robustness and generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, allowing lifelong operation. We present an exhaustive evaluation in 27 sequences from the most popular datasets. ORB-SLAM achieves unprecedented performance with respect to other state-of-the-art monocular SLAM approaches. For the benefit of the community, we make the source code public.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The medial axis transform (or MAT) is a representation of an object as an infinite union of balls. We consider approximating the MAT of a three-dimensional object, and its complement, with a finite union of balls. Using this approximate MAT we define a new piecewise-linear approximation to the object surface, which we call the power crust. We assume that we are given as input a sufficiently dense sample of points from the object surface. We select a subset of the Voronoi balls of the sample, the polar balls, as the union of balls representation. We bound the geometric error of the union, and of the corresponding power crust, and show that both representations are topologically correct as well. Thus, our results provide a new algorithm for surface reconstruction from sample points. By construction, the power crust is always the boundary of a polyhedral solid, so we avoid the polygonization, hole-filling or manifold extraction steps used in previous algorithms. The union of balls representation and the power crust have corresponding piecewise-linear dual representations, which in some sense approximate the medial axis. We show a geometric relationship between these duals and the medial axis by proving that, as the sampling density goes to infinity, the set of poles, the centers of the polar balls, converges to the medial axis.},

The algorithm consumes an amount of memory more or less linear in the number of objects. The basic ideas can be characterized with a modified BSP tree and plane traversal. Plane traversal is a fast linear time algorithm to find the closest intersection point in a list of bounding volumes hit by a ray. We use plane traversal at every node of the high outdegree BSP tree. Our implementation is competitive to fast ray-tracing programs. We present a benchmark suite that allows for an extensive comparison of ray-tracing algorithms.},

The laser samples the local geometry of the environment and is used to incrementally build a 3D point-cloud map of the workspace. Sequences of images from the camera are used to detect loop closure events (without reference to the internal estimates of vehicle location) using a novel appearance-based retrieval system. The loop closure detection is robust to repetitive visual structure and provides a probabilistic measure of confidence. The images suggesting loop closure are then further processed with their corresponding local laser scans to yield putative Euclidean image-image transformations. We show how naive application of this transformation to effect the loop closure can lead to catastrophic linearization errors and go on to describe a way in which gross, pre-loop closing errors can be successfully annulled. We demonstrate our system working in a challenging, outdoor setting containing substantial loops and beguiling, gently curving traversals. The results are overlaid on an aerial image to provide a ground truth comparison with the estimated map. The paper concludes with an extension into the multi-robot domain in which 3D maps resulting from distinct SLAM sessions (no common reference frame) are combined without recourse to mutual observation},

  abstract  = {The objective of the Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) laser ranging investigation is to obtain high integrity profiles and grids of topography for use in geophysical, geodetic and geological studies of asteroid 433 Eros. The NEAR laser rangefinder (NLR) will determine the slant range of the NEAR spacecraft to the asteroid surface by measuring precisely the round trip time of flight of individual laser pulses. Ranges will be converted to planetary radii measured with respect to the asteroid center of mass by subtracting the spacecraft orbit determined from X band Doppler tracking. The principal components of the NLR include a 1064 nm Cr:Nd:YAG laser, a gold-coated aluminum Dall-Kirkham Cassegrain telescope, an enhanced silicon avalanche photodiode hybrid detector, a 480-MHz crystal oscillator, and a digital processing unit. The instrument has a continuous in-flight calibration capability using a fiber-optic delay assembly. The single shot vertical resolution of the NLR is 6 m, and the absolute accuracy of the global grid will be $\sim$ 10 m with respect to the asteroid center of mass. For the current mission orbital scenario, the laser spot size on the surface of Eros will vary from $\sim$4--11 m, and the along-track resolution for the nominal pulse repetition rate of 1 Hz will be approximately comparable to the spot size, resulting in contiguous along-track profiles. The across-track resolution will depend on the orbital mapping scenario, but will likely be 500 m, which will define the spatial resolution of the global topographic model. Planned science investigations include global-scale analyses related to collisional and impact history and internal density distribution that utilize topographic grids as well as spherical harmonic topographic models that will be analyzed jointly with gravity at commensurate resolution. Attempts will be made to detect possible subtle time variations in internal structure that may be present if Eros is not a single coherent body, by analysis of low degree and order spherical harmonic coefficients. Local- to regional-scale analyses will utilize high-resolution three-dimensional topographic maps of specific surface structures to address surface geologic processses. Results from the NLR investigation will contribute significantly to understanding the origin, structure, and evolution of Eros and other asteroidal bodies.},

  abstract   = {Abstract The surface topography of Asteroid 25143 Itokawa is explored using the LIght Detection And Ranging instrument (LIDAR). The data confirm the presence of a rough highland and a smooth lowland. The highland is dominated by boulders, but also possesses topography associated with surface lineaments and broad surface facets. The boulders ensure that the roughness of the highlands over short distances is typically greater relative to most surfaces on 433 Eros. Over larger distances, Itokawa is always smoother than Eros possibly because of its smaller size and weak rubble-pile structure. The lowlands of Itokawa are very smooth, and are typically devoid of boulders. Some transitional regions midway between the highlands and lowlands also exist. In these areas, craters that retain their regolith fill possess flat floors and resemble {\textquotedblleft}ponds{\textquotedblright} seen on 433 Eros. Analyses of surface elevation, imagery and a quantitative measure of surface roughness are consistent with regolith flowing downhill from the highlands to fill in the low areas of Itokawa, probably covering up any pre-existing rough terrain. Using this interpretation, we find a minimum 2.3$\pm$0.4 m thick layer of regolith in the lowlands, which, if spread evenly across the entire asteroid, corresponds to a 42$\pm$1 cm thick layer. It is very difficult to generate this amount of regolith with the population of craters seen on Itokawa. However, an Itokawa composed of several large masses may have retained this regolith during its formation. The presence of such large masses could account for the observed lineaments and what appear to be exposures of bedrock on the largest steep slope observed.},

We present the first results from analyses of topographic profiles interpreted with the aid of simultaneous, boresighted images obtained by the NEAR multispectral imager (MSI). The location of the NLR boresight relative to that of MSI is determined by detailed correlations of ranging data and simultaneous images, including cases where the laser boresight slewed off and on the limb of the asteroid and cases where the laser illuminated a boulder close to the time of an image. In the data presented, the precision of the range measurements is about 1 m, with the minimum spot diameter under 5 m, and successive spots are contiguous or overlapping. Elevation on the irregular object Eros is given with respect to the gravitational and centrifugal potential. Landslides in craters are characterized. Possible crater benches are identified. Examples of infilled craters are presented. These observations suggest a depth of unconsolidated regolith, which is subject to sliding, of typically a few tens of meters. An example of structurally controlled cratering is presented. Examples of tectonic features are described. Surface roughness on Eros is approximately self-affine from scales of a few meters to hundreds of meters. A comparison of fractal statistics shows that Eros is extremely rough on observed scales, when compared to terrestrial a'a lava on submeter scales and undisturbed lunar regolith on subcentimeter scales.},

  year      = {2015},
  abstract  = {As the complexity and boldness of emerging mission proposals increase, and with the rapid evolution of the available computational capabilities, high-accuracy and high-resolution gravity models and the tools to exploit such models are increasingly attractive within the context of spaceflight mechanics, mission design and analysis, and planetary science in general. First, in trajectory design applications, a gravity representation for the bodies of interest is, in general, assumed and exploited to determine the motion of a spacecraft in any given system. The focus is the exploration of trajectories in the vicinity of a system comprised of two small irregular bodies. Within this context, the primary bodies are initially modeled as massive ellipsoids and tools to construct third-body trajectories are developed. However, these dynamical models are idealized representations of the actual dynamical regime and do not account for any perturbing effects. Thus, a robust strategy to maintain a spacecraft near reference third-body trajectories is constructed. Further, it is important to assess the perturbing effect that dominates the dynamics of the spacecraft in such a region as a function of the baseline orbit. Alternatively, the motion of the spacecraft around a given body may be known to extreme precision enabling the derivation of a very high-accuracy gravity field for that body. Such knowledge can subsequently be exploited to gain insight into specific properties of the body. The success of the NASA's GRAIL mission ensures that the highest resolution and most accurate gravity data for the Moon is now available. In the GRAIL investigation, the focus is on the specific task of detecting the presence and extent of subsurface features, such as empty lava tubes beneath the mare surface. In addition to their importance for understanding the emplacement of the mare flood basalts, open lava tubes are of interest as possible habitation sites safe from cosmic radiation and micrometeorite impacts. Tools are developed to best exploit the rich gravity data toward the numerical detection of such small features.},

  year      = {2016},
  abstract  = {An algorithm for autonomous online mission design at asteroids, comets, and small moons is developed to meet the novel challenges of their complex non-Keplerian orbit environments, which render traditional methods inapplicable. The core concept of abstract reachability analysis, in which a set of impulsive maneuvering options is mapped onto a space of high-level mission outcomes, is applied to enable goal-oriented decision-making with robustness to uncertainty. These nuanced analyses are efficiently computed by utilizing a heuristic-based adaptive sampling scheme that either maximizes an objective function for autonomous planning or resolves details of interest for preliminary analysis and general study. Illustrative examples reveal the chaotic nature of small body systems through the structure of various families of reachable orbits, such as those that facilitate close-range observation of targeted surface locations or achieve soft impact upon them. In order to fulfill extensive sets of observation tasks, the single-maneuver design method is implemented in a receding-horizon framework such that a complete mission is constructed on-the-fly one piece at a time. Long-term performance and convergence are assured by augmenting the objective function with a prospect heuristic, which approximates the likelihood that a reachable end-state will benefit the subsequent planning horizon. When state and model uncertainty produce larger trajectory deviations than were anticipated, the next control horizon is advanced to allow for corrective action --- a low-frequency form of feedback control. Through Monte Carlo analysis, the planning algorithm is ultimately demonstrated to produce mission profiles that vary drastically in their physical paths but nonetheless consistently complete all goals, suggesting a high degree of flexibility. It is further shown that the objective function can be tuned to preferentially minimize fuel cost or mission duration, as well as to optimize performance under different levels of uncertainty by appropriately balancing the mitigation paradigms of robust planning and reactive execution.},

  abstract  = {The Mars Pathfinder spacecraft will land on a depositional fan near the mouth of the catastrophic outflow channel, Ares Vallis (19.5{$^{\circ}$}N, 32.8{$^{\circ}$}W). This site offers the prospect of analyzing a variety of rock types from the ancient cratered highlands, intermediate-age ridged plains, and reworked channel deposits. Analyses of these rocks by Pathfinder instruments will enable first-order scientific questions to be addressed, such as differentiation of the crust, the development of weathering products, and the nature of the early environment, as well as their subsequent evolution on Mars. Constraints imposed by (1) spacecraft and rover designs (which are robust), (2) entry, descent, and landing, (3) scientific potential at various sites, and (4) safety were important considerations in site selection. Engineering constraints require a 70 km by 200 km smooth, flat (low slopes) area located between 10{$^{\circ}$} and 20{$^{\circ}$}N that is below 0 km elevation, with average radar reflectivity, little dust, and moderate rock abundance. Three regions on Mars are between 10{$^{\circ}$} and 20{$^{\circ}$}N and below 0 km elevation: Chryse, Amazonis, and Isidis-Elysium. Science considerations favor sites at the mouths of outflow channels (grab bag sites offer an assay of rock types on Mars), highland sites (early crustal differentiation and climate), and sites covered with dark (unoxidized) material. Sites are considered safe if they are clearly below 0 km elevation, appear acceptably free of hazards in high-resolution (50 m/pixel) Viking orbiter images and have acceptable reflectivity and roughness at radar wavelengths, thermal inertia, rock abundance, red to violet ratio, and albedo. Recent 3.5-cm wavelength radar observations were used to verify elevation, reflectivity, and roughness within the landing ellipses. Three sites meet all of these criteria: Ares Vallis, Tritonis Lacus, and Isidis. Although Isidis appears to be safer than Tritonis and Ares, the greater scientific potential at Ares Vallis resulted in its selection. Comparisons of the Grand Coulee (channel) and the depositional Ephrata Fan of the Channeled Scabland in eastern Washington, with Ares Vallis and its depositional fan also suggest the Ares Vallis landing site is safe and scientifically interesting.},

The Itokawa surface is full of boulders against expectation and there are few flat areas where the spacecraft can touchdown safely. With the reaction wheels lost prior to the events, it was very difficult to control translation motion accurately, since the guidance accuracy of several millimeters per second was requested. The guidance and navigation before launch assumed the autonomous guidance by identifying the illumination center aboard. However, it was not successful due to the highly irregular shape of the asteroid. On the other hand, the scenario based on the terrain recognition in quasi real time well worked. It was anticipated not useful before launch, since such process was conceived to take a lot of time and not effectively useful in real time operation. The Hayabusa project team devised and built the special tool on the ground and had tuned it before the successful three touchdowns and one long landing on the surface.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

  abstract   = {The mobile robot localization problem is treated as a two-stage iterative estimation process. The attitude is estimated first and is then available for position estimation. The indirect (error state) form of the Kalman filter is developed for attitude estimation when applying gyro modeling. The main benefit of this choice is that combined dynamic modeling of the mobile robot and its interaction with the environment is avoided. The filter optimally combines the attitude rate information from the gyro and the absolute orientation measurements. The proposed implementation is independent of the structure of the vehicle or the morphology of the ground. The method can easily be transferred to another mobile platform provided it carries an equivalent set of sensors. The 2D case is studied in detail first. Results of extending the approach to the 3D case are presented. In both cases the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

  year          = {2008},
  abstract      = {There is much current interest in understanding the formation and evolution of the small bodies of our solar system. In addition, current astronomical observations suggest that 16% of the Near Earth Asteroid population is made of binary asteroids. A robotic mission sent to one of these systems provides double scientific opportunities to investigate their composition and their dynamical characteristics, thus motivating this research. The Full Two Body Problem (F2BP) models a binary system taking into account the entire mass distribution of one or both bodies. It is important to understand the motion of the binary system itself before studying the motion of particles or spacecraft in this environment, which is referred as the Restricted Full Three Body Problem (RF3BP). The F2BP model used herein is an ellipsoid-sphere system, which reduces the complexity of the problem while keeping interesting dynamical features. The current research looks at the conditions for the system to be in relative equilibrium. It is found that the equilibrium states are the minimum energy points of nearby periodic families. Simulations indicate possible paths from unstable to stable configurations, giving insights on how these binary systems may evolve in time. In modeling the dynamics of a spacecraft in this relatively small scale environment compared to the sun and planets, these systems can be thought of as being "mini" Three Body Problems, where the motion is strongly perturbed by the system's dynamics and by solar effects. These dynamics are analyzed using libration points, energy constraints, periodic orbits, and other methods of astrodynamics for a binary in relative equilibrium, and also accounting for perturbed motion of the primaries. Since the ellipsoidal body introduces surface constraints, the thesis also explores motion on the surface of these bodies, using transit trajectories between the two bodies and impact dynamics and control of landers. Finally, an innovative mission proposal is developed that takes advantage of the unique dynamical environment at binary asteroids to carry out a scientific exploration mission. A case study is presented for the binary system 1999 KW4 and compared to other observed binary systems.},

Three typical location estimation schemes of triangulation, scene analysis, and proximity are analyzed. We also discuss location fingerprinting in detail since it is used in most current system or solutions. We then examine a set of properties by which location systems are evaluated, and apply this evaluation method to survey a number of existing systems. Comprehensive performance comparisons including accuracy, precision, complexity, scalability, robustness, and cost are presented.},

  abstract   = {A navigation system that tracks the location of a person on foot is useful for finding and rescuing firefighters or other emergency first responders, or for location-aware computing, personal navigation assistance, mobile 3D audio, and mixed or augmented reality applications. One of the main obstacles to the real-world deployment of location-sensitive wearable computing, including mixed reality (MR), is that current position-tracking technologies require an instrumented, marked, or premapped environment. At InterSense, we've developed a system called NavShoe, which uses a new approach to position tracking based on inertial sensing. Our wireless inertial sensor is small enough to easily tuck into the shoelaces, and sufficiently low power to run all day on a small battery. Although it can't be used alone for precise registration of close-range objects, in outdoor applications augmenting distant objects, a user would barely notice the NavShoe's meter-level error combined with any error in the head's assumed location relative to the foot. NavShoe can greatly reduce the database search space for computer vision, making it much simpler and more robust. The NavShoe device provides not only robust approximate position, but also an extremely accurate orientation tracker on the foot.},

  abstract   = {Numerous applications require a self-contained personal navigation system that works in indoor and outdoor environments, does not require any infrastructure support, and is not susceptible to jamming. Posture tracking with an array of inertial/magnetic sensors attached to individual human limb segments has been successfully demonstrated. The "sourceless" nature of this technique makes possible full body posture tracking in an area of unlimited size with no supporting infrastructure. Such sensor modules contain three orthogonally mounted angular rate sensors, three orthogonal linear accelerometers and three orthogonal magnetometers. This paper describes a method for using accelerometer data combined with orientation estimates from the same modules to calculate position during walking and running. The periodic nature of these motions includes short periods of zero foot velocity when the foot is in contact with the ground. This pattern allows for precise drift error correction. Relative position is calculated through double integration of drift corrected accelerometer data. Preliminary experimental results for various types of motion including walking, side stepping, and running document accuracy of distance and position estimates.},
