  abstract     = {The tracking techniques employed by the SUPER RADOT system are enabled through automated control by a large mini-digital computer. The operational mode calibration, error determination, designate, acquisition and track functions are mechanized by a modular software package which is integrated and controlled through mode switch and matrix panels located in a control console. The auto-track functions allow collection of atmosphere limited precision target angular position data. The systematic error content of the vehicle position data is determined through definition of tracker error model coefficients by application of star track error determination techniques. The distribution of star data point residuals after correction model fit indicates systematic error sigmas for azimuth and elevation coordinates of less than Â±1.0 arc seconds. Sunlit reentry targets have been detected and acquired by the optical-video sensor and auto-tracked by the video processor at slant ranges in excess of 1000 kilometers.},
