## Master `texmf` tree

This holds all the packages and files that I commonly use for LaTeX.

The structure is defined as follows:

`~\texmf\bibtex\bib` for bib files
`~\texmf\tex\latex\local\` for style files

* Windows:
    `C:\Users\username\texmf\`
* MacOS:
    `/Users/username/Library/texmf/`
* Unix: 
    `/home/username/texmf`
